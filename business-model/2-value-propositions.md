# **🎯 Goal:** Articulate EFI’s core value propositions—the pain-relievers and gain-creators that address priority segments’ critical jobs, pains, and gains—so each claim can be traced back to a *Testing Business Ideas* experiment and a block in the master VPA.

**Strategyzer Lens:** Every claim must

1. Relieve a critical pain or create a valued gain for a priority segment,

2. Map to a supporting Key Activity or Resource, and

3. Be linked to a **Desirability (D) experiment card** on the *Testing Business Ideas* (TBI) board.
