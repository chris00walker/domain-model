## Phase 2 Regional Scale—Channel Multipliers (months 12–36 ) 

### Regional Business-to-Business (B2B) Segment:

11. ### Cruise-Line Provisioning & Ship Chandlers:

* **Characteristics:** Global cruise brands and their contracted chandlers that restock an entire vessel in a single lift; demand HACCP traceability, mixed-temperature pallets, and tight turnaround at Miami, Port Everglades, San Juan, or Bridgetown.

* **Jobs:** Replenish hundreds of SKUs on schedule; guarantee food-safety compliance; minimise quay time and paperwork.

* **Pains:** Port-delay penalties, complex customs paperwork, fragmented regional suppliers, temperature-abuse risk.

* **Pain Relievers:** Port-centric consolidation hubs, single customs-cleared shipment per call, HACCP chain-of-custody, mixed-temp pallet engineering.

* **Gains:** Faster turnarounds, lower demurrage, assured compliance, simplified vendor management.

* **Gain Creators:** 24 / 7 on-call logistics team, rapid-response inspections, real-time temperature telemetry, multi-port contract coverage.

* **EFI Product/Service Market Fit:** EFI unifies Caribbean sourcing and just-in-time port delivery, cutting hand-offs and downtime while guaranteeing traceable authenticity—exactly what cruise galleys and chandlers value. 

**Preliminary Recommendation:** **Park – defer proactive effort** 

**Rationale:** This segment demands 24/7 port-side logistics, mixed-temperature pallet engineering, and working-capital head-room to absorb quay-time penalties. Until EFI has a proven regional consolidation hub and surplus capital, the risk-adjusted return is inferior to the importer channel. Monitor inbound inquiries, but invest no proactive sales resources until Phase 3\.

---

12. ### Partner Importers & Distributors (Regional “Channel Multipliers” — Expansion Channel – Prioritise from Month 12.):

* **Characteristics:** Privately owned food-import houses or specialty distributors that clear customs, hold food-safety licences, and resell pallets/cases to retailers, hotels, and restaurants across one or more islands (e.g., Hadco T\&T, Do-It Curaçao). **This is EFI’s default growth channel** outside Barbados; all other regional segments (11, 13-15) are optional direct lanes used case-by-case.

* **Jobs:** Add authentic Levantine & Mediterranean depth to their portfolio; grow category margin; manage inventory risk; provide marketing support to downstream accounts.

* **Pains:** Fragmented small suppliers, missing documentation, high MOQs tie up cash, weak storytelling slows velocity.

* **Pain Relievers:** Mixed-SKU containers with full cert dossiers, island-sized MOQs (½-pallet per SKU), and co-branded QR content kits.

* **Gains:** Faster category launch, higher turns, stronger reseller loyalty, improved gross margin per pallet.

* **Gain Creators:** Volume-based rebates, vendor-managed sell-through dashboards, marketing-development funds (MDF), consolidated freight savings.

* **EFI Product/Service Market Fit:** EFI is a single turnkey source—provenance, paperwork, pallets, and content—so importers scale an entire Levantine set without supplier wrangling or inventory overload. 

**Preliminary Recommendation:** **Prioritise activation from Month 12**

**Rationale:** Importers multiply reach across multiple islands with minimal EFI overhead, accept mixed-SKU containers, and provide pallet-level volumes that can double Barbados GMV while preserving our asset-light model. CAC/payback is incorporated into FOB margin assumptions, and MDF-funded sell-through dashboards keep velocity high. Begin outreach once Barbados velocity data is available (≈ Month 10).

---

13. ### Caribbean Regional Supermarket Chains & Large Retail/DC Buyers:

* **Characteristics:** Corporate supermarket groups and food-service distribution centres (Massy Stores, GraceKennedy, Sysco Bahamas, Florida ethnic chains such as Sedano’s and Presidente) that import directly for their own stores or commissaries but **do not resell onward**. May purchase direct for private-label volumes; otherwise are serviced via Partner Importers to avoid channel conflict.

* **Jobs:** Keep shelves or DCs stocked with high-velocity Levantine & Mediterranean SKUs, hit margin targets, refresh ethnic aisles, support private-label programs.

* **Pains:** Slotting-fee risk on unproven items, supply interruptions, fragmented compliance docs, consumer scepticism about authenticity.

* **Pain Relievers:** Proven velocity data, island-to-island cold-chain, EDI-integrated ordering, on-pack QR storytelling.

* **Gains:** Higher category growth, reduced out-of-stocks, credible provenance stories that justify shelf space and private-label premiums.

* **Gain Creators:** Turnkey private-label development, volume-based rebates, marketing collateral, consolidated freight discounts.

* **EFI Product/Service Market Fit:** EFI supplies shelf-ready SKUs (or private-label equivalents) with rock-solid provenance and logistics—boosting ethnic-set performance while protecting margin and brand trust. 

**Preliminary Recommendation:** **Park – defer proactive effort**

**Rationale:** These buyers require slotting allowances, EDI integration, and velocity proof; CAC is 3-4× higher than the importer channel and creates potential channel conflict. Defer proactive engagement until the importer network is mature and EFI can lead with private-label programs backed by proven sell-through data.

---

14. ### Caribbean Resort & All-Inclusive Group HQs (Direct FCL, Internal Consumption):

* **Characteristics:** Corporate F\&B procurement teams for multi-property resort brands (Sandals, AMResorts, Marriott C\&LA) balancing premium guest experiences with centralised purchasing efficiency.

* **Jobs:** Secure authentic, premium ingredients across properties; standardise quality; support menu innovation; meet sustainability pledges.

* **Pains:** Inconsistent supplier standards across islands, high freight costs, difficulty marrying “local sourcing” promises with scale.

* **Pain Relievers:** Corporate-wide SLAs, farm-direct Levantine & Mediterranean SKUs with full traceability, consolidated regional shipping, on-site chef demos.

* **Gains:** Consistent guest satisfaction, marketing lift from authentic storytelling, streamlined procurement, predictable landed costs.

* **Gain Creators:** Multi-property volume pricing, chef-curated seasonal packs, sustainability dashboards, site visits for audits and menu trials.

* **EFI Product/Service Market Fit:** EFI blends central contract efficiency with boutique-level authenticity—letting resort HQs deliver wow-factor menus while meeting cost and ESG targets. 

**Preliminary Recommendation:** **Park – defer proactive effort**

**Rationale:** Resort HQs offer large contract volumes but require multi-property SLAs, ESG audits, and chef demos. Operational complexity rivals cruise lines without comparable early-stage upside. Engage reactively to inbound RFPs, but postpone a dedicated sales motion until mixed-SKU FCL flow and compliance dashboards are fully operational.

## Phase 3 International Trading—USA \+ Brazil (months 36 \+) 

### International Business-to-Business (B2B) Segment:

15. ### Florida & Brazil Ethnic & Specialty Retail Chains:

* **Characteristics:** Multi-store chains in Florida—Publix (ethnic set), Sedano’s, Presidente—and Brazil—Pão de Açúcar Gourmet, Zona Sul, Super Nosso, Mundo Verde—serving diaspora shoppers and adventurous foodies; all demand slotting support and high shelf-turns.

* **Jobs:** Rapidly refresh ethnic aisles with authentic, story-driven Levantine & Mediterranean products; minimise slotting risk; drive traffic and basket size.

* **Pains:** Consumer scepticism about authenticity, high promo costs, supply interruptions that erode shelf-space ROI, diverse labelling requirements (US vs. Brazil ANVISA).

* **Pain Relievers:** Provenance-rich bilingual packaging, launch promo co-funding, Florida cross-dock \+ Santos cross-dock for 48-h replenishment, dependable fill-rates, complete ANVISA/HACCP dossiers.

* **Gains:** Faster category growth, higher foot traffic, clear differentiation from mainstream sets, lower spoilage, compliance peace-of-mind.

* **Gain Creators:** QR-based storytelling, influencer demo kits shipped for launch events, Portuguese & English social content packs, sales-velocity analytics to optimise assortments. 

**Preliminary Recommendation:** **Park – defer proactive effort** (reassess in Phase 3\)

**Rationale:** Although strategically important, this channel entails slotting fees, bilingual packaging, ANVISA dossiers, and intense category-management competition. CAC and regulatory workload are too high before EFI’s Florida cross-dock and Brazil compliance stack are live. Continue building bilingual provenance assets during Phase 2 so the offer is turnkey when revisited post-launch.

| **Phase 2***Regional Importers* | • LinkedIn & trade-rag lead gen• Virtual tasting webinar• FOB quote bot | First container booked ≤ 60 d from first contact | No container by 90 d | 🔗 |

---

## **3 │ Channel Design Rationale (Strategyzer Lens)**

1. **Segment Fit:** Diaspora & Expats engage on Facebook & WhatsApp; Food-Trucks seek menu inspo on Instagram; Mini-Markets follow trade publications.

2. **Jobs & Pains:** WhatsApp bot instantly answers “Is it Halal?” (pain ✓); QR demo soothes authenticity anxiety (gain ✓).

3. **Cost Harmony:** CAC ≤ BBD 20 (B2C) and ≤ BBD 50 (B2B) align with VPA margin targets; footnoted formula ensures transparency.

4. **Fail-Safe:** If the B2B portal slips past M7 or has \> 3 defects, the manual order form keeps revenue flowing.

5. **Post-Exchange Nurture:** WhatsApp drips deliver tips and cross-sells, driving repeat orders and higher LTV.

6. **Experiment-Ready:** Every row links to its TBI card so teams can launch and measure experiments without friction.

---

## **4 │ KPI Dashboard (Channel Layer)**

* **B2C:** CAC, AOV, sessions→purchase, subscription churn, NPS

* **B2B:** Lead-to-quote ratio, quote-to-order, CAC payback orders, reorder cycle

* **Cross-channel:** Marketing spend as % of GMV ≤ 8 % (Phase 1 target)

---

## **5 │ Next Steps**

1. Populate each 🔗 placeholder with the actual Desirability experiment card link.

2. Sync with Finance to bake the CAC formula (**CAC \= (Ad \+ Creative \+ Sales labour) / New Accounts**) into your dashboards.

3. Implement the manual order-form fail-safe for Phase 1B.

4. Build and schedule the Post-Exchange WhatsApp drip workflow.

5. Review and adjust CAC thresholds after the first Channel experiment.

---

# **🎯 Goal:** Craft a Strategyzer-ready **Customer Relationships** block that picks up where Channels ends—at **Exchange**—and guides each priority segment through **Experience → Satisfaction → Significance**, maximising LTV while protecting the gross-margin and CAC guardrails in the master VPA.

**Strategyzer Lens:** Every relationship mechanic must

1. Start at Exchange and move customers toward Significance,

2. Map to a measurable KPI, and

3. Be linked to a **Desirability (F) experiment card** on the *Testing Business Ideas* (TBI) board.

## **2 │ Relationship Mechanisms & Rationale**

1. **Self-Service First (B2C)** – AI chatbot \+ FAQ hub resolves ≥ 70 % of tickets under 2 min → frees margin for loyalty perks.

2. **High-Touch Lite (B2B)** – Dedicated AM for Mini-Markets & LSR pilots; Food-Truck WhatsApp hotline keeps CAC payback \< 1 order.

3. **Mutual Upside Incentives** – Referral, volume rebates, and VIP tiers mirror customer gains (social pride, cost control) and are directly testable.

4. **Shared Digital Spine** – HubSpot tickets \+ Odoo order data feed a unified NPS & CLV dashboard, enabling rapid A/B on perks.

2. **Enforce perk cap**: Configure Smile.io to cap total perk spend at ≤ 10 % of incremental VIP GM[1](https://chatgpt.com/c/68306eee-e300-8006-9054-d2e32e1e1625#user-content-fn-2), and model stacked discounts against margin floors.

3. **Assign NPS recovery owner**: Appoint the **CRM Manager** to monitor NPS triggers, lead recovery actions, and report weekly.

4. Draft and link the four Experiment Cards (use the 🔗 placeholders above) with hypotheses, metrics, and cheap-test designs.

5. Build the unified NPS & CLV dashboard in HubSpot/Odoo and validate data flows.

## **Footnotes**

1. **Perk spend ≤ 10 % of incremental VIP GM**

2. **CLV \= Σ (GM per order × avg orders × retention rate) − CAC**

# **🎯 Goal:** Define EFI’s **Revenue Streams & Pricing** block so every dollar of income is transparently linked to the value delivered, the costs incurred, and the experiments queued in *Testing Business Ideas*.

**Strategyzer Lens:** Every revenue stream must

1. mirror a customer job or pain,

2. protect its gross-margin floor, and

3. be linked to a **Viability (V) experiment card** on the *Testing Business Ideas* (TBI) board.

 • β \= 0.4 γ \= 0.5 T \= 45 days  
 • Bound by segment GM floors once Phase 2 begins.

---

## **5 │ Pricing Governance & Promo Rules**

* **Pricing Governance SOP:**  
   CFO will freeze the dynamic-pricing engine if Pocket GM falls below its floor for two consecutive weeks; pricing changes resume only after a formal CFO-approved review.

* **Promo Stacking Guardrail:**  
   Enforced one-promo-per-order rule (see [1](https://chatgpt.com/c/68306eee-e300-8006-9054-d2e32e1e1625#user-content-fn-1)) ensures margins are never eroded by multiple discounts.

* **Evidence-Level Scoring:**  
   Each Viability experiment card is scored 1–5 based on supporting data strength to prioritise tests efficiently.

# **🎯 Goal:** Guard EFI’s gross-margin floors and cash runway by making every dollar traceable to a Key Activity, Resource, or Partner—while keeping fixed overhead low enough that scale always widens contribution margin.

**Strategyzer lens:** A cost structure is the “flip side” of the Value Proposition. Each cost block must

1. link to the Activity/Resource/Partner it funds (KA/KR/KP),

2. state its Fixed vs Variable split,

3. name a Steward,

4. highlight the Scale lever that bends its unit cost curve, and

5. be linked to a **Viability (V) experiment card** on the *Testing Business Ideas* (TBI) board.

---

## **1 │ Guiding Principles**

| Principle | How EFI Applies It |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Variable-first** | ≥ 75 % of spend flexes with volume; fixed ≤ 25 %. |
| **Own the brand, rent the rest** | 3PL, cloud, SaaS, AI, and freelancers replace capex and payroll. |
| **One stack, many segments** | Single tech \+ logistics spine serves Retail, Commercial, and Wholesale, avoiding duplication. |
| **Guardrails before growth** | Segment-specific GM floors (Retail ≥ 40 %, Commercial ≥ 30 %, Wholesale ≥ 25 %). |
| **Tech & Growth efficiency** | Combined Tech \+ Growth spend ≤ 15 % GMV (umbrella KPI; triggers review if exceeded). |

---

## **2 │ Margin Guardrail Table 🛡️**

| Segment | Target GM Floor | Price-Floor Formula | Guardrail KPI | TBI Card |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Retail (B2C)** | ≥ 40 % | (COGS \+ Fulfilment) / 0.60 | Pocket GM % | 🔗 V-CS-01 |
| **Commercial (B2B)** | ≥ 30 % | (COGS \+ Fulfilment) / 0.70 | Pocket GM % | 🔗 V-CS-02 |
| **Wholesale (B2B)** | ≥ 25 % | (COGS \+ Fulfilment) / 0.75 | Volume-discount leakage % | 🔗 V-CS-03 |

*Violation of any guardrail for 2 rolling months triggers a Pricing or Cost sprint on the Testing Business Ideas board.*

## **4 │ Optimisation Cadence**

| Cadence | Action |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Bi-Weekly** | Pause any ad set with ROAS \< 2× over 7-day rolling. |
| **Monthly** | Review dashboard; flag KPI drift \> 10 %. Resize SaaS/API tiers to keep Tech ≤ 8 % GMV; Growth ≤ 7 % GMV. |
| **Quarterly** | Renegotiate suppliers/3PL when 3-mo volume ↑ 25 %. Zero-based budget on fixed costs; refresh ad creatives; freeze campaigns if CAC \> 0.4 × LTV. |
| **Board Review** | Highlight KPI variance \> 10 % or leakage \> 5 % revenue; trigger Cost sprint if needed. |
| **Annual** | Hedge review; insurance bid; convert aged fixed costs to variable if feasible. |

---

## **5 │ How the Structure Supports EFI**

* **Lean & Outsourced:** 75 % variable cost keeps cash burn tied to revenue cycles.

* **Tri-Segment Synergy:** One cost base supports all three revenue streams.

* **Data-Driven Margins:** Real-time guardrails tie every cost line to live GM dashboards.

* **FX Resilience:** 0.5 % GMV reserve ensures volatility buffer backed by NDF hedge.

*“Put your outdoor work in order and get your fields ready; after that, build your house.”* — Proverbs 24:27
