## 2. Strategic Design

| Sub-Domain | Context | Integration Style | Notes |
|------------|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Customer Management | Customers | Shared Kernel | Core domain, well-implemented with proper aggregates and entities |
| Product Catalog | Catalog | Shared Kernel | Core domain, partially implemented, missing complete aggregates |
| Order Processing | Ordering | Shared Kernel | Supporting domain, basic implementation present |
| Subscription Service | Subscriptions | Shared Kernel | Core domain, implementation in progress |
| Payment Processing | Payments | Conformist | Supporting domain, planned but not yet implemented |

### Context Map Analysis
```
[Customers] <---> [Shared Kernel] <---> [Catalog]
     |                  ^                   |
     v                  |                   v
[Subscriptions] <----->[Ordering]<------->[Pricing]
```

The bounded contexts primarily integrate through the Shared Kernel pattern, with domain events used for cross-context communication. This design allows for independent evolution while maintaining consistency.

## 3. Tactical Findings

| Aggregate | Issue | File | Recommendation |
|-----------|-------|------|----------------|
| Customer | Strong implementation, good encapsulation | `/customers/domain/aggregates/Customer.ts` | Consider adding domain events for customer status changes |
| DiasporaCustomer | Good specialization, but invariants not explicitly documented | `/customers/domain/aggregates/DiasporaCustomer.ts` | Add invariant documentation in comments |
| Order | Basic implementation, but lacks order state transitions | `/ordering/domain/aggregates/Order.ts` | Implement explicit state machine pattern for order lifecycle |
| Subscription | Implemented but missing subscription renewal logic | `/subscriptions/domain/aggregates/Subscription.ts` | Add explicit renewal policy and events |
| Product | Missing complete aggregate implementation | `/catalog/domain/` | Implement Product as proper aggregate with inventory management |

### Strengths

1. **Strong Domain Model Structure**: The codebase demonstrates a well-structured domain model with clear separation into bounded contexts.
2. **Value Objects Implementation**: Proper implementation of value objects with immutability and validation.
3. **Aggregate Root Pattern**: Consistent use of aggregate roots to enforce invariants and encapsulate domain logic.
4. **Domain Events**: Good implementation of domain events for cross-context communication.
5. **Module Boundaries**: Clear module boundaries enforced through path aliases in tsconfig.json.

### Risks & Gaps

1. **Incomplete Catalog Domain**: The catalog domain is only partially implemented, missing key aggregates.
2. **Limited Domain Event Usage**: While the infrastructure exists, domain events aren't consistently used across all aggregates.
3. **Missing Repository Implementations**: Some aggregates lack corresponding repository implementations.
4. **Invariant Documentation**: Domain invariants are enforced in code but not explicitly documented.
5. **Integration Patterns**: The reliance on shared kernel for most integration could lead to coupling if not carefully managed.

## 4. Quick-Win Actions

1. Document domain invariants explicitly in code comments for each aggregate
2. Complete the Product aggregate implementation in the catalog domain
3. Increase use of domain events for cross-bounded context communication
4. Add missing repository implementations for all aggregates
5. Enhance the domain event pattern to include event handlers and subscriptions
6. Add comprehensive validation in value objects, especially for business rule enforcement
7. Create explicit context boundaries diagram to visualize integration points

## 5. Open Questions

1. How will the Payments bounded context integrate with external payment providers while maintaining domain integrity?
2. What is the strategy for handling distributed transactions across bounded contexts?
3. How will the system manage eventual consistency when domain events span multiple bounded contexts?
4. What is the testing strategy for verifying domain invariants and business rules?
5. How will the domain model evolve as the business expands to new markets in Phase 2 and 3?
6. Is there a plan to implement CQRS pattern for complex reporting requirements mentioned in business constraints?
7. How will the multilingual requirements (EN/AR) impact the domain model implementation?
