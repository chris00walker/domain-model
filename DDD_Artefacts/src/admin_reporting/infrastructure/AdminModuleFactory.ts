// TODO: MongoDB infrastructure factory commented out to maintain pure domain model approach
// This file contains MongoDB-specific implementations that violate the framework-agnostic principle
// Uncomment and implement when ready to add infrastructure layer with proper dependency injection

/*
Entire AdminModuleFactory class commented out to maintain pure domain model approach.
This factory depends on MongoDB infrastructure which violates our framework-agnostic DDD principles.

Original implementation included:
- MongoClient dependency
- MongoDB repository implementations
- Infrastructure service wiring
- Factory pattern for dependency injection

To restore:
1. Install mongodb and @types/mongodb dependencies
2. Uncomment the implementation below
3. Ensure proper error handling and type safety
4. Wire up with application layer when ready
