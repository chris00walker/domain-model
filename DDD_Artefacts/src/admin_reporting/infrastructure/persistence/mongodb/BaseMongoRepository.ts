// TODO: BaseMongoRepository commented out to maintain pure domain model approach
// This file contains MongoDB-specific implementations that violate the framework-agnostic principle
// Uncomment and implement when ready to add infrastructure layer with proper dependency injection

/*
Entire BaseMongoRepository class commented out to maintain pure domain model approach.
This base class depends on MongoDB infrastructure which violates our framework-agnostic DDD principles.

Original implementation included:
- MongoClient dependency
- MongoDB Collection operations
- ObjectId usage
- Abstract repository pattern with MongoDB-specific operations

To restore:
1. Install mongodb and @types/mongodb dependencies
2. Uncomment the implementation below
3. Ensure proper error handling and type safety
4. Wire up with concrete repository implementations when ready

// Placeholder export to maintain module structure
export const BaseMongoRepository = undefined;
