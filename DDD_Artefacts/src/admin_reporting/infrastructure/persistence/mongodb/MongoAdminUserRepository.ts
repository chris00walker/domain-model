/*
Entire MongoAdminUserRepository class commented out to maintain pure domain model approach.
This repository depends on MongoDB infrastructure which violates our framework-agnostic DDD principles.

Original implementation included:
- MongoClient dependency
- MongoDB Collection operations
- BaseMongoRepository extension
- AdminUser persistence mapping
- Role repository integration

To restore:
1. Install mongodb and @types/mongodb dependencies
2. Uncomment the implementation below
3. Ensure proper error handling and type safety
4. Wire up with domain services when ready
