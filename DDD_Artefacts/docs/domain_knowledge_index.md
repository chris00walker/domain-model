# Domain Knowledge Index

## Overview
This document serves as the central entry point for the Elias Food Imports (EFI) domain knowledge repository. It organizes and links to all domain knowledge documents created as part of our modular documentation approach.

## Purpose
The domain knowledge repository provides a comprehensive understanding of EFI's business domains, their strategic importance, core concepts, business rules, and implementation recommendations. It serves as the authoritative reference for domain-driven design implementation.

## Document Structure
All domain knowledge documents follow a consistent structure:

1. **Domain Overview**: Brief description and strategic classification
2. **Strategic Importance**: Business value and strategic priorities
3. **Core Concepts**: Key domain concepts and their definitions
4. **Business Rules**: Explicit business rules governing the domain
5. **Domain Events**: Events published by the domain
6. **Aggregates and Entities**: Key domain objects with properties, behaviors, and invariants
7. **Value Objects**: Immutable objects representing domain concepts
8. **Domain Services**: Services that orchestrate domain operations
9. **Integration Points**: How the domain interacts with other domains
10. **Implementation Recommendations**: Suggested patterns and approaches

## Core Domains

### [Pricing Domain](domain_knowledge_pricing.md)
The Pricing domain manages all aspects of product pricing, including tiered pricing structures, dynamic pricing algorithms, promotional rules, and margin protection mechanisms. It directly impacts revenue generation and supports EFI's premium positioning strategy.

### [Subscription Domain](domain_knowledge_subscription.md)
The Subscription domain manages subscription lifecycle, tier-based services, billing workflows, and retention strategies. It provides a stable revenue stream and enhances customer loyalty through recurring service relationships.

### [Catalog Authentication Domain](domain_knowledge_catalog_auth.md)
The Catalog Authentication domain handles product authenticity verification, provenance tracking, and authentication token management. It supports EFI's premium positioning by ensuring product authenticity and provenance.

## Supporting Domains

### [Customer Domain](domain_knowledge_customer.md)
The Customer domain manages customer profiles, segmentation, tier assignment, and preferences. It supports personalized experiences and enables tier-based pricing and subscription services.

### Catalog Domain (Planned)
The Catalog domain will manage product information, categorization, search, and display. It will support the core domains by providing comprehensive product information.

### Order Domain (Planned)
The Order domain will manage the order lifecycle, from creation through fulfillment and delivery. It will integrate with pricing, customer, and inventory domains to provide a seamless ordering experience.

### Inventory Domain (Planned)
The Inventory domain will manage product availability, stock levels, and supply chain integration. It will support dynamic pricing and catalog display by providing real-time inventory information.

## Cross-Domain Integration

### [Domain Event Catalog](domain_knowledge_events.md)
The Domain Event Catalog documents standardized event schema, detailed domain events, cross-domain event flows, and implementation guidelines. It ensures consistent event-driven communication across domains.

### [Bounded Context Map](domain_knowledge_context_map.md)
The Bounded Context Map documents relationships between contexts, integration patterns, shared kernels, anti-corruption layers, and implementation guidelines. It provides a high-level view of how domains interact.

## Using This Repository

### For Developers
- Use these documents to understand domain concepts and business rules
- Reference the implementation recommendations when designing and coding
- Consult the bounded context map to understand cross-domain interactions

### For Domain Experts
- Verify that domain concepts and business rules are accurately captured
- Suggest updates when business rules or concepts evolve
- Use these documents to communicate with technical teams

### For New Team Members
- Start with this index to get an overview of all domains
- Focus on your specific domain document for detailed understanding
- Reference the bounded context map to see how your domain interacts with others

## Maintenance Guidelines
- Each domain document should be reviewed quarterly
- Updates should be made when business rules or concepts change
- Major changes should be communicated to all stakeholders
- The bounded context map should be updated when integration patterns change
