# Review Domain

<!-- GAP_IMPLEMENTED: Authentication Integration | Low | Medium | Medium -->
<!-- stub for "Authentication Integration" gap in the review context -->

## Domain Overview

The Review Domain manages the collection, processing, and utilization of customer feedback about products in the Elias Food Imports (EFI) system. It encompasses all aspects of product reviews, ratings, and feedback mechanisms that help ensure product quality and improve customer satisfaction.

## Strategic Importance

The Review Domain is strategically important to Elias Food Imports for the following reasons:

1. **Product Quality Assurance**: Customer reviews provide real-world insights into product quality, helping identify issues requiring attention
2. **Customer Trust Building**: Transparent review systems build trust with customers by showing commitment to quality and customer satisfaction
3. **Social Proof**: Positive reviews serve as social proof for potential customers, driving new sales and customer acquisition
4. **Data-Driven Product Development**: Review data informs product improvements and new product development
5. **Marketing Content Generation**: Authentic reviews provide valuable content for marketing campaigns
6. **Counterfeit Detection**: Review patterns can help identify potentially counterfeit products in the market

## Core Concepts

### 1. Review

A formal assessment of a product provided by a customer after purchase or consumption, including both quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback.

### 2. Rating

A numerical score (typically on a 1-5 scale) that quantifies a customer's satisfaction with a product.

### 3. Review Moderation

The process of evaluating user-submitted reviews to ensure they meet content guidelines before they are published.

### 4. Sentiment Analysis

The systematic identification, extraction, and categorization of opinions expressed in review text to determine whether the reviewer's attitude is positive, negative, or neutral.

### 5. Verified Purchase

A designation indicating that a review was submitted by a customer who purchased the product through official EFI channels, enhancing the credibility of the review.

### 6. Review Response

An official reply from EFI or product suppliers to customer reviews, addressing concerns or acknowledging feedback.

### 7. Review Aggregation

The process of combining multiple reviews to generate summary statistics and insights about product performance.

## Business Rules

### Review Submission

1. Only registered customers who have purchased a product may submit reviews for that product
2. Customers may only submit one review per product, but may edit their review within 30 days of submission
3. Reviews must include both a rating (1-5 scale) and a text comment of at least 20 characters
4. Reviews cannot be submitted until at least 7 days after product delivery to ensure adequate usage experience
5. Customers cannot review products they themselves supply (in the case of marketplace sellers)

### Review Content

1. Review content must not contain profanity, personal attacks, or promotional material
2. Review content must not contain personally identifiable information or contact details
3. Reviews discussing product authenticity must be flagged for investigation by the Catalog Authentication Context
4. Images attached to reviews must be directly related to the product being reviewed
5. All review content must comply with EFI's content guidelines and terms of service

### Review Moderation

1. All reviews must pass through moderation before being publicly displayed
2. Reviews must be moderated within 48 hours of submission
3. Rejected reviews must include a rejection reason that is communicated to the customer
4. Reviews containing critical product quality or safety concerns must be escalated to Quality Assurance within 24 hours
5. Moderation decisions can be appealed by customers once per review

### Review Display

1. Reviews are displayed in order of helpfulness ranking, with verified purchase reviews given priority
2. Review summary statistics must be updated within 1 hour of a new review being approved
3. Products with fewer than 5 reviews should display an "Early Reviews" indicator
4. Reviews older than 12 months must be clearly labeled as such
5. Reviews for previous versions of a product must be clearly distinguished from current version reviews

### Review Analysis

1. All reviews must be analyzed for sentiment and key topics within 24 hours of approval
2. Products receiving three consecutive 1-star reviews must trigger a quality alert
3. Significant deviations in average rating (>1 point within a 30-day period) must trigger an investigation
4. Review patterns indicating potential misuse must be flagged for fraud investigation
5. Review metrics must be included in monthly product performance reports
