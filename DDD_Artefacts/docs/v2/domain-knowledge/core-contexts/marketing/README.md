## Core Concepts

### Campaign
A coordinated series of marketing activities designed to achieve specific business objectives, such as product launches, seasonal promotions, or customer acquisition initiatives. Campaigns have defined start and end dates, target audiences, budgets, and success metrics.

### Content
Marketing materials including product descriptions, cultural and regional information, recipes, pairing recommendations, and promotional offers that enhance product value and customer engagement. Content may be translated and localized for specific regional markets.

### Segment

### Channel
Communication medium used to deliver marketing messages to customers, including email, social media, website, mobile app notifications, SMS, and print materials. Each channel has specific requirements and best practices.

### Engagement Metrics
Quantitative measures of customer interactions with marketing content, including open rates, click-through rates, conversion rates, and social media engagement. These metrics inform campaign effectiveness and future marketing strategies.

### A/B Test
Controlled experiment comparing two or more variations of marketing content or strategy to determine which performs better against defined metrics. A/B tests guide optimization of marketing efforts through data-driven decision-making.

## Implementation Recommendations

### Architecture

1. **CQRS Pattern Implementation**: The Marketing domain should implement Command Query Responsibility Segregation to optimize for both high-volume read operations (content retrieval, segment queries) and transactional write operations (campaign management).

2. **Hexagonal Architecture**: Implement using a ports and adapters (hexagonal) approach to isolate domain logic from external systems and integration mechanisms.

3. **Event-Driven Communication**: Utilize an event-driven approach for integration with other bounded contexts, publishing domain events for key state changes and subscribing to relevant events from other domains.

4. **Data Partitioning**: Consider content and campaign data partitioning strategies to handle large volumes of marketing assets across diverse product categories and regions.

### Technical Considerations

1. **Segment Processing Engine**: Build a specialized processing engine for customer segment calculation that can efficiently evaluate segment criteria against large customer datasets.

2. **Content Repository**: Implement a dedicated content repository with versioning support, search capabilities, and media asset management.

3. **Performance Metrics Dashboard**: Create a real-time analytics dashboard for campaign and segment performance monitoring.

4. **A/B Testing Framework**: Build infrastructure to support A/B testing of marketing content and campaigns with statistical analysis capabilities.

### Priority Implementations

Based on the company's strategic priorities, implement the following components in order:

1. **Customer Segment Webhooks** (Priority 4): Create webhook infrastructure to notify external systems of segment changes and membership updates. This aligns with the CRM/Marketing Foundation priority in the implementation plan.

2. **Segment Type Enhancements**: Extend the segmentation system to support new segmentType enumerations and segment-specific value objects for more sophisticated customer targeting.

3. **Content Service Backend**: Implement storage and retrieval systems for cultural content to enrich product marketing with authentic regional context.

### Testing Strategy

1. **Segment Calculation Tests**: Verify segment membership rules with comprehensive test cases covering boundary conditions and complex criteria.

2. **Campaign Performance Simulator**: Create a simulation environment to test campaign performance metrics calculation.

3. **Content Approval Workflow Tests**: Ensure content management workflows correctly enforce approval processes and permissions.

4. **Integration Testing**: Focus on testing integrations with Customer and Catalog contexts as these are the most critical for Marketing operations.
