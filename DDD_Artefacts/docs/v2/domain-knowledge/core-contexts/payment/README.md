# Payment Domain

## Overview

The Payment domain manages the processing, tracking, and reconciliation of all financial transactions for Elias Food Imports. It handles payment capture, refunds, and chargebacks while ensuring compliance with financial regulations and security standards. The domain serves as a critical link between customer orders and financial systems, providing secure and reliable transaction processing while supporting various payment methods preferred by different international customer segments.

## Strategic Classification

**Domain Type**: Core Domain

**Business Value**: High  
Payment processing is critical to revenue collection and directly impacts customer trust, financial reporting accuracy, and operational cash flow.

**Technical Complexity**: High  
The domain requires secure integration with multiple payment gateways, strict compliance with financial regulations, fraud detection capabilities, and robust error handling.

**Volatility**: Medium  
Core payment concepts are stable, but payment methods, gateway integrations, and compliance requirements evolve over time with new financial technologies and regulations.

## Business Rules

### Payment Processing

1. All payment amounts must be validated against order totals before processing with a zero-tolerance variance.
2. Payment capture must occur only after inventory has been successfully reserved.
3. Payments exceeding €5,000 require additional verification and manual approval.
4. Failed payment attempts must be logged with detailed error information for troubleshooting.
5. A payment can be attempted up to 3 times before being marked as permanently failed.
6. Payment methods availability varies by customer region and order value.

### Refund Processing

1. Full refunds can be processed automatically up to 30 days after purchase.
2. Partial refunds require manager approval and documented reason codes.
3. Refunds for orders containing perishable goods that have been shipped require special authorization.
4. Refund amount cannot exceed the original payment amount.
5. Bulk refunds (affecting more than 20 orders) require finance department approval.
6. Customer refund history must be tracked to identify potential abuse patterns.

### Chargebacks and Disputes

1. All chargebacks must be responded to within 7 business days with appropriate evidence.
2. Chargebacks representing more than 1% of monthly transaction volume trigger risk review procedures.
3. Repeated chargebacks from the same customer result in account review and possible restriction.
4. Product authenticity disputes must involve the Catalog Authentication domain for verification.
5. Chargeback disputes must include delivery confirmation when the reason is "product not received."
6. Settlement offers can be made for disputed transactions at 75% of the original amount with approval.

### Payment Security and Compliance

1. Payment card data must never be stored in Elias Food Imports systems.
2. All payment processing must comply with PCI-DSS standards.
3. Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) must be implemented for European customers per PSD2 regulations.
4. Suspicious transaction patterns must be flagged for manual review.
5. Multi-currency transactions must use approved exchange rates updated daily.
6. Transaction logs must be retained for 7 years for compliance and audit purposes.

<!-- stub for "Multi-Currency Support" gap in the payment context -->

### Financial Reconciliation

1. All payments must be reconciled with bank statements daily with 100% accuracy.
2. Discrepancies greater than €100 require immediate investigation and documentation.
3. Settlement timeframes must be tracked by payment method and factored into cash flow projections.
4. Payment fees must be recorded separately for accurate financial reporting.
5. Multi-currency reconciliation must account for exchange rate fluctuations.
6. Monthly financial close processes require verification of all payment transactions.

  private _orderId: OrderId;
  private _amount: Money;
  private _status: PaymentStatus;
  private _method: PaymentMethod;
  private _transactionId?: string;

  public fail(reason: string): Result<void, string>
  public initiateRefund(refundId: string, amount: Money): Result<void, string>
  public receiveChargeback(chargebackId: string, amount: Money, reason: string): Result<void, string>
  
  // Invariants

  // - Status transitions follow lifecycle rules
  // - Captured payments cannot transition to Failed
}
```

### Value Objects

```typescript
// PaymentStatus
enum PaymentStatus {
  Initiated = 'INITIATED',
  Captured = 'CAPTURED',
  Failed = 'FAILED',
  Refunded = 'REFUNDED',
  PartiallyRefunded = 'PARTIALLY_REFUNDED',
  Chargeback = 'CHARGEBACK'
}

// PaymentMethod
enum PaymentMethod {
  Card = 'CARD',
  PayPal = 'PAYPAL',
  BankTransfer = 'BANK_TRANSFER'
}

// PaymentId
class PaymentId extends ValueObject<{ value: string }> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Domain Services

```typescript
// PaymentProcessor
interface PaymentProcessor {
  authorize(payment: Payment): Promise<Result<string, PaymentError>>
  capture(payment: Payment): Promise<Result<void, PaymentError>>
  refund(payment: Payment, amount: Money): Promise<Result<void, PaymentError>>
}

  getById(paymentId: PaymentId): Promise<Payment | null>
  getByOrderId(orderId: OrderId): Promise<Payment[]>
  getByStatus(status: PaymentStatus, limit: number): Promise<Payment[]>
}
```
