## Core Concepts

### 1. Analytics Event

A standardized data structure representing business activities, user interactions, or system events captured for analytical purposes, enriched with contextual information and timestamps.

### 2. Data Warehouse

The central repository where unified, cleansed data from various operational systems is stored in a structured format optimized for analytical processing and reporting.

### 3. Data Mart

A subset of the data warehouse focused on a specific business area, department, or analytical domain (e.g., Sales, Marketing, Operations) with contextualized metrics.

### 4. Metric

A quantifiable measure that tracks and assesses business performance, such as conversion rate, average order value, customer lifetime value, or inventory turnover rate.

### 5. Dimension

An attribute that provides context to metrics and allows for slicing, filtering, and segmenting of data (e.g., time, product, geography, customer segment).

### 6. Dashboard

A visual representation of key metrics, KPIs, and analytical insights, customized for specific business functions or user roles to enable data-driven decision making.

### 7. Data Pipeline

The workflow that extracts data from source systems, transforms it according to business rules, and loads it into the analytical data store for processing and analysis.

### 8. Analytical Model

A statistical or machine learning algorithm that processes historical data to identify patterns, make predictions, or generate recommendations.
