# Order Domain

## Domain Overview

The Order domain is responsible for managing the entire order lifecycle from creation through fulfillment and post-delivery processes. This domain handles customer orders for Elias Food Imports' specialty food products, including order placement, validation, payment processing, fulfillment, shipping, and order-related customer communications.

## Strategic Classification

**Classification**: Core Domain

**Justification**: The Order domain is central to Elias Food Imports' business operations, directly handling the company's primary value exchange with customers. It integrates numerous other domains and provides a critical customer touchpoint that directly impacts customer satisfaction, revenue generation, and operational efficiency.

## Core Domain Concepts

### Order
A customer request to purchase one or more products, representing the primary transaction between customer and Elias Food Imports.

### Order Line
An individual product entry within an order, containing product details, quantity, pricing, and customization information.

### Order Status
The current state of an order within its lifecycle (e.g., Created, Confirmed, In Progress, Shipped, Delivered, Completed, Cancelled).

### Fulfillment
The process of preparing an order for shipment, including picking, packing, and quality verification steps.

### Shipping
The logistics process of transporting an ordered product from Elias Food Imports to the customer's delivery location.

### Payment
The financial transaction associated with an order, including authorization, capture, and potential refund operations.

### Order Modification
A customer-initiated change to an existing order before it is shipped, which may affect price, quantities, delivery information, or payment details.

### Return
A post-delivery process where a customer sends products back to Elias Food Imports due to issues or dissatisfaction.

### Gift Order
A specialized order type where the purchaser and the recipient are different individuals, with special handling for messaging, pricing display, and delivery.

## Business Rules

### Order Creation and Validation

1. An order must contain at least one order line.
2. Each order line must reference a valid, available product.
3. Order quantity must be greater than zero and less than or equal to the maximum allowed quantity per order (50 items).
4. Orders must have valid shipping and billing addresses.
5. Orders with special handling requirements (cold chain, fragile items) must be flagged appropriately.
6. Total order value must not exceed €10,000 without special approval.
7. Orders containing age-restricted products require age verification.

### Payment Processing

1. Payment must be authorized before order fulfillment begins.
2. For orders over €500, payment must be fully captured before shipping.
3. Payment methods must match the billing address country.
4. Failed payments must trigger notification to the customer with retry options.
5. After three failed payment attempts, the order is automatically cancelled.
6. Partial payments are only allowed for split shipments.

### Fulfillment and Shipping

1. Orders must pass a fraud check before entering the fulfillment process.
2. Products requiring authentication must be verified before packing.
3. Cold chain products require special packaging and expedited shipping.
4. International orders require complete customs documentation.
5. Orders with all items in stock must begin fulfillment within 24 hours of payment.
6. Split shipments are created when some items are out of stock and backorder is enabled.
7. Each package must have a tracking number assigned before leaving the warehouse.

### Order Modifications

1. Orders can only be modified if they have not entered the fulfillment stage.
2. Modification that changes the order total requires payment re-authorization.
3. Shipping address changes on in-process orders require manager approval.
4. Adding products to an existing order creates a new payment requirement for the difference.
5. Order modifications must maintain all original order constraints (minimum quantity, etc.).

### Returns and Refunds

1. Return requests must be initiated within 30 days of delivery.
2. Perishable products cannot be returned unless quality issues are verified.
3. Return shipping for defective products is paid by Elias Food Imports.
4. Refunds are processed within 5 business days of return receipt and inspection.
5. Partial returns result in partial refunds based on the specific items returned.

### Special Order Types

1. Gift orders must hide pricing information in packing slips and include gift messages when provided.
2. Wholesale orders require business verification and minimum quantity thresholds.
3. Employee orders receive standard discount but follow normal fulfillment processes.
4. Orders flagged as "expedited" must be processed within 4 hours during business hours.

### Context Mapping

The Order bounded context uses several strategic patterns to integrate with other contexts:

#### Shared Kernel

The Order context shares a kernel with the following contexts:

- **Customer Context**: Shares customer profile models to maintain consistent customer representation
- **Catalog Context**: Shares product models to ensure consistent product representation across ordering

#### Customer/Supplier Relationship

- As Supplier (Upstream):
  - To **Shipping Context**: Order context defines order structure that shipping must adapt to
  - To **Analytics Context**: Order context provides order events in a format suitable for analytics

- As Customer (Downstream):
  - To **Inventory Context**: Order context relies on inventory availability and reservation
  - To **Payment Context**: Order context consumes payment processing services
  - To **Pricing Context**: Order context uses pricing rules for order calculation

#### Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)

- Between **Order Context** and **Legacy ERP System**: Translates between modern domain model and legacy order structure
- Between **Order Context** and **External Marketplace APIs**: Adapts external marketplace order formats to internal domain model

#### Open Host Service

- Order context provides a published order API for various consumers including external partners and internal services

#### Conformist

- Order context conforms to the **Finance Context** for tax calculation and financial reporting

### Integration Mechanism Details

#### RESTful API

```typescript
// Example API endpoint implementation for order creation
@POST
@Path("/orders")
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public Response createOrder(OrderRequest orderRequest) {
  try {
    // Convert request to command
    PlaceOrderCommand command = orderRequestToCommandMapper.map(orderRequest);
    
    // Process command
    CommandResult result = commandGateway.send(command);
    
    // Return appropriate response
    OrderCreatedResponse response = new OrderCreatedResponse(
      result.getOrderId(), 
      result.getStatus(),
      result.getEstimatedShipDate()
    );
    
    return Response.status(Status.CREATED)
      .entity(response)
      .build();
  } catch (Exception e) {
    // Error handling
  }
}
```

#### Event Publishing

```typescript
// Example of publishing domain events
class OrderEventPublisher implements DomainEventPublisher {
  constructor(
    private readonly eventBus: EventBus,
    private readonly eventMapper: EventMapper
  ) {}

  public async publishOrderCreated(order: Order): Promise<void> {
    const event = this.eventMapper.mapToOrderCreatedEvent(order);
    await this.eventBus.publish('order.created', event);
  }
  
  public async publishOrderConfirmed(order: Order): Promise<void> {
    const event = this.eventMapper.mapToOrderConfirmedEvent(order);
    await this.eventBus.publish('order.confirmed', event);
  }
  
  // Other event publishing methods...
}
```

#### Service Integration

```typescript
// Example of integrating with external services
class CatalogServiceAdapter implements ProductService {
  constructor(private readonly catalogClient: CatalogApiClient) {}
  
  public async getProductDetails(productId: string): Promise<ProductDetails> {
    try {
      const catalogProduct = await this.catalogClient.getProduct(productId);
      return this.mapToProductDetails(catalogProduct);
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle integration errors
      throw new ProductServiceException(`Failed to retrieve product: ${error.message}`);
    }
  }
  
  private mapToProductDetails(catalogProduct: any): ProductDetails {
    // Transform external model to domain model
  }
}
```

#### Anti-corruption Layer Example

```typescript
// Example of ACL for legacy system integration
class LegacyErpOrderAdapter implements ExternalOrderSystem {
  constructor(private readonly erpClient: ErpClient) {}
  
  public async exportOrder(order: Order): Promise<void> {
    // Transform domain order to legacy format
    const erpOrder = this.transformToErpOrder(order);
    
    try {
      await this.erpClient.createOrder(erpOrder);
    } catch (error) {
      throw new ErpIntegrationException(`Failed to export order: ${error.message}`);
    }
  }
  
  private transformToErpOrder(order: Order): ErpOrderDto {
    // Complex mapping logic to transform modern domain model 
    // to legacy ERP system format
    return {
      order_number: order.getId().getValue(),
      customer_code: this.mapCustomerToLegacyCode(order.getCustomerId()),
      order_date: this.formatDateForErp(order.getOrderDate()),
      lines: this.mapOrderLinesToErpFormat(order.getOrderLines()),
      // Additional ERP-specific mappings
    };
  }
  
  // Other mapping and transformation methods...
}
```

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Architecture

#### Domain Layer Components

- **Aggregates**: Order, Shipment, Return
- **Entities**: OrderLine, Address, Payment
- **Value Objects**: OrderId, Money, Address, ShippingDetails
- **Domain Services**: OrderValidationService, OrderPricingService, FraudDetectionService, ReturnProcessingService
- **Domain Events**: OrderCreated, OrderConfirmed, OrderCancelled, OrderShipped, etc.

#### Application Layer Components

- **Command Handlers**: PlaceOrderCommandHandler, ConfirmOrderCommandHandler, CancelOrderCommandHandler
- **Event Handlers**: PaymentAuthorizedEventHandler, InventoryReservedEventHandler
- **Application Services**: OrderApplicationService, ReturnApplicationService
- **DTOs**: OrderDTO, OrderLineDTO, ReturnRequestDTO

#### Infrastructure Layer Components

- **Repositories**: OrderRepository, ReturnRepository
- **Data Models**: OrderDataModel, OrderLineDataModel, ShipmentDataModel
- **External Service Adapters**: CatalogServiceAdapter, PaymentGatewayAdapter, ShippingServiceAdapter
- **Event Publishers**: OrderEventPublisher

### Persistence Strategy

#### Primary Database

The Order context uses a relational database as the primary storage mechanism due to the need for ACID transactions and complex relational integrity between orders, order lines, shipments, and returns.

**Database Schema**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id UUID NOT NULL,
  order_number VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  status VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  order_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  currency VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL,
  subtotal DECIMAL(19,2) NOT NULL,
  tax DECIMAL(19,2) NOT NULL,
  shipping_cost DECIMAL(19,2) NOT NULL,
  total_amount DECIMAL(19,2) NOT NULL,
  shipping_address_id UUID,
  billing_address_id UUID,
  payment_details_id UUID,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (shipping_address_id) REFERENCES addresses(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (billing_address_id) REFERENCES addresses(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (payment_details_id) REFERENCES payment_details(id)
);

CREATE TABLE order_lines (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id UUID NOT NULL,
  product_id UUID NOT NULL,
  quantity INT NOT NULL,
  unit_price DECIMAL(19,2) NOT NULL,
  discount_amount DECIMAL(19,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  tax_amount DECIMAL(19,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  line_total DECIMAL(19,2) NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id)
);

CREATE TABLE shipments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id UUID NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  carrier VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  tracking_number VARCHAR(100),
  shipping_method VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  shipped_date TIMESTAMP,
  estimated_delivery_date TIMESTAMP,
  actual_delivery_date TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id)
);

-- Additional tables for returns, addresses, payment details, etc.
```

#### Event Sourcing Considerations

For critical parts of the Order lifecycle, particularly those with complex state transitions and audit requirements (such as order status changes, payment authorizations, and returns), an event sourcing approach is recommended.

Key benefits for the Order context:

1. **Complete Audit Trail**: Every order status change is captured as an immutable event
2. **Temporal Queries**: Ability to reconstruct the state of an order at any point in time
3. **Event Replay**: Can replay events to rebuild state or for testing scenarios
4. **Easier Integration**: Facilitates integration with other contexts through event publication

**Implementation Approach**:

- Store all domain events in an event store
- Rebuild aggregate state from event stream
- Use snapshots for performance optimization
- Project events to dedicated read models for efficient querying

### CQRS Implementation

The Order context is a good candidate for CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) due to the different access patterns for order processing versus order reporting.

**Command Side**:
- Focused on processing order transactions (create, confirm, cancel, ship)
- Uses the domain model for validation and business rule enforcement
- Optimized for write operations
- Ensures consistency with strong transactional boundaries

**Query Side**:
- Optimized for fast retrieval of order information
- Denormalized read models for different query needs
- Asynchronously synchronized with the command side via events

**Read Models**:
1. **OrderSummaryReadModel**: For customer-facing order history
2. **OrderDetailsReadModel**: For detailed order information
3. **OrderFulfillmentReadModel**: For staff handling fulfillment
4. **OrderAnalyticsReadModel**: For reporting and analytics

### Scalability Considerations

**High-Volume Processing**:
- Implement horizontal scaling for order processing
- Use message queues to handle traffic spikes during sales events
- Implement backpressure mechanisms to prevent system overload

**Data Partitioning**:
- Partition orders by time periods (current/historical orders)
- Consider regional partitioning for international operations

**Caching Strategy**:
- Cache frequently accessed order data
- Use distributed caching for order status information
- Implement cache invalidation based on order events

### Transaction Boundaries

**Order Creation**:
- A single transaction should cover order creation, line items, and initial inventory check
- Payment authorization should be a separate transaction with compensation patterns

**Order Fulfillment**:
- Shipment creation and inventory deduction should be in the same transaction
- Multiple shipments may require a saga pattern to coordinate several transactions

**Returns and Refunds**:
- Return authorization and refund processing should be separate transactions
- Use a saga pattern to coordinate the entire return/refund process

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Test aggregates, entities, value objects, and domain services in isolation
   - Use test doubles to replace external dependencies

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test repositories and infrastructure services against test databases
   - Verify interactions with external services using test doubles

3. **Acceptance Testing**:
   - Test complete order workflows from creation to fulfillment
   - Verify domain events are properly raised and handled

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test order processing throughput under load
   - Simulate high-volume ordering scenarios (e.g., flash sales)

5. **Chaos Testing**:
   - Test resilience to failures in dependent services
   - Verify correct behavior when dependent services are slow or unavailable

### Security Considerations

1. **Data Protection**:
   - Encrypt sensitive order data (payment details, personal information)
   - Implement field-level encryption for PII

2. **Access Control**:
   - Define fine-grained permissions for order operations
   - Implement row-level security for multi-tenant environments

3. **Audit Logging**:
   - Log all order modifications with user information
   - Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements

4. **Fraud Prevention**:
   - Implement real-time fraud detection for orders
   - Use machine learning to improve fraud detection rates

### Implementation Priorities

1. **Phase 1: Core Order Processing**
   - Order aggregate with basic lifecycle
   - Integration with Catalog and Customer contexts
   - Basic order creation and confirmation flows

2. **Phase 2: Payment and Fulfillment**
   - Integration with Payment context
   - Order fulfillment workflows
   - Shipment tracking and updates

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features**
   - Returns and refunds processing
   - Gift orders and special order types
   - Multi-currency support

4. **Phase 4: Optimization and Scaling**
   - Performance optimizations
   - CQRS implementation
   - Advanced analytics and reporting
