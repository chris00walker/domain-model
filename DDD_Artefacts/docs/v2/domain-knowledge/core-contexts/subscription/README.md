The Subscription domain manages recurring product deliveries and relationships between Elias Food Imports and its customers. It handles the entire subscription lifecycle, including creation, modification, fulfillment, billing, and cancellation. This domain is strategically important as it represents a growing revenue stream and builds long-term customer relationships.

## Strategic Importance

**Classification**: Core Domain

**Justification**: Subscriptions provide predictable recurring revenue, higher customer lifetime value, and a competitive advantage through personalized curation of specialty food products. This domain is critical for customer retention and represents a growing revenue stream for Elias Food Imports.

## Core Domain Concepts

### Subscription
A recurring arrangement for the delivery of products at defined intervals, with customizable parameters and preferences.

### Subscription Plan
A template defining the structure, benefits, and pricing model of a subscription offering.

### Billing Cycle
The recurring period for which a customer is charged for their subscription.

### Delivery Schedule
The recurring pattern of when products from a subscription will be delivered.

### Curation
The process of selecting products for a subscription based on customer preferences and seasonal availability.

## Business Rules

1. All subscriptions must have a defined billing frequency and delivery schedule.
2. Subscriptions can be paused for a maximum of 90 days before requiring reactivation.
3. Changes to a subscription take effect on the next billing cycle unless explicitly requested for immediate processing.
4. Customers must receive notification at least 3 days before a subscription renewal.
5. Subscription discounts are applied based on subscription longevity and tier.
6. Substitutions for out-of-stock items must honor customer preferences and dietary restrictions.
7. Cancellations before a billing cycle completes must be prorated according to the defined refund policy.
8. "Surprise me" subscriptions must never include previously delivered items within a 3-month period unless requested.
9. Seasonal collections must be curated at least 1 month before their availability date.
10. Free shipping applies to all subscriptions with monthly value exceeding the defined threshold.

## Integration Points

### Customer Context
- **Integration Type**: Customer-Supplier Relationship
- **Data Exchange**:
  - Customer profiles, preferences, and segments
  - Subscription history for customer records
- **Communication Mechanism**:
  - REST API for customer data retrieval
  - Domain events for customer status changes

### Catalog Context
- **Relationship**: Provides product information and availability
- **Communication Mechanism**:
  - CQRS for product catalog queries
  - Domain events for product changes
- **Consistency Requirements**: Eventual consistency for product data
- **Key Integration Points**:
  - Product availability → Subscription fulfillment
  - Product changes → Subscription updates

## Implementation Recommendations

### Architecture
1. **Modular Design**: Structure the subscription service as a set of loosely coupled modules:
   - Subscription Management
   - Billing Engine
   - Delivery Scheduling
   - Customer Experience
   - Analytics & Reporting

2. **Event Sourcing**: Consider using event sourcing for the subscription aggregate to maintain a complete audit trail of all state changes.

3. **Saga Pattern**: Implement long-running processes (e.g., subscription lifecycle) using the Saga pattern to maintain consistency across bounded contexts.

### Technical Implementation
1. **API Design**:
   - RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
   - Webhook support for asynchronous event notifications
   - GraphQL for flexible data querying

2. **Data Storage**:
   - Primary: Document database for subscription data
   - Secondary: Relational database for reporting and analytics
   - Caching layer for frequently accessed data

3. **Resilience**:
   - Implement circuit breakers for external service calls
   - Retry policies with exponential backoff
   - Dead letter queues for failed messages

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Cover all domain logic, value objects, and business rules
2. **Integration Tests**: Verify interactions with other bounded contexts
3. **Contract Tests**: Ensure API compatibility with consumers
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Validate complete subscription workflows

### Monitoring & Observability
1. **Key Metrics**:
   - Subscription growth rate
   - Churn rate
   - Renewal success rate
   - Delivery success rate
   - Payment success/failure rates

2. **Alerting**:
   - Failed subscription renewals
   - Payment processing errors
   - Delivery scheduling issues
   - Integration point failures

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Blue/Green Deployments**: For zero-downtime updates
2. **Feature Flags**: For gradual rollout of new features
3. **Canary Releases**: For testing with a subset of users

### Security Considerations
1. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - OAuth 2.0 with JWT
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Fine-grained permissions

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - PII protection
   - Audit logging

### Performance Optimization
1. **Caching**:
   - Subscription details
   - Customer preferences
   - Product information

2. **Asynchronous Processing**:
   - Background jobs for non-critical operations
   - Event-driven architecture for loose coupling

### Documentation
1. **API Documentation**:
   - OpenAPI/Swagger
   - Code examples
   - Error handling reference

2. **Operational Documentation**:
   - Deployment procedures
   - Monitoring setup
   - Troubleshooting guides

### Future Considerations
1. **Multi-currency Support**
2. **Tiered Subscription Plans**
3. **Gift Subscriptions**
4. **Family/Group Subscriptions**
5. **AI-Powered Product Recommendations**

### Inventory Context
- **Integration Type**: Open Host Service
- **Data Exchange**:
  - Product availability checks
  - Inventory allocation for subscription items
- **Communication Mechanism**:
  - REST API for availability checks
  - Event subscription for low inventory notifications
- **Consistency Requirements**: Near real-time consistency for inventory checks

### Notification Context
- **Integration Type**: Published Language
- **Data Exchange**:
  - Subscription status changes
  - Delivery notifications
  - Renewal reminders
- **Communication Mechanism**:
  - Domain events for notification triggers
- **Consistency Requirements**: Eventual consistency acceptable

## Additional Considerations

### CQRS Pattern

The Subscription domain is well-suited for Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) due to the difference between its write and read operations:

- **Command Side**: Focused on subscription lifecycle management (create, modify, pause, cancel)
- **Query Side**: Optimized for various read models (customer portal views, analytics dashboards, operational reports)

Implementation approach:
- Separate command and query models
- Event sourcing for subscription state changes
- Denormalized read models for specific query needs

### Eventual Consistency

Subscription state changes should be propagated to other contexts with appropriate eventual consistency mechanisms:

- Real-time updates for critical operations (payment processing)
- Batch processing for non-critical updates (analytics)
- Event-driven synchronization for dependent contexts

### Caching Strategy

Implement a multi-level caching strategy:

- Cache subscription plans and their features (rarely changing)
- Time-limited caching for subscription details (moderately changing)
- No caching for real-time status information (frequently changing)

### Performance Optimizations

Optimize for the following scenarios:

- Bulk renewal processing for monthly/annual subscription cohorts
- Product curation algorithm efficiency
- Delivery scheduling optimization across geographic regions

### Testing Approach

Implement comprehensive testing focusing on:

- Business rule validation through domain model tests
- Integration tests for context boundaries
- Performance tests for bulk operations
- State transition tests for subscription lifecycle

## Success Metrics
