## Domain Overview

The Notification Domain for Elias Food Imports (EFI) is responsible for managing all types of communications with customers, partners, and internal stakeholders. It serves as a central hub for processing, formatting, delivering, and tracking notifications across multiple channels while ensuring appropriate targeting, personalization, regulatory compliance, and delivery confirmation.

## Strategic Importance

The Notification Domain is strategically important to Elias Food Imports for the following reasons:

1. **Customer Experience**: Timely, relevant communication is essential for positive customer experience
2. **Operational Efficiency**: Centralized notification management reduces duplication and overhead
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures all communications adhere to legal requirements (e.g., GDPR, CAN-SPAM)
4. **Brand Consistency**: Maintains uniform messaging and branding across all communication channels
5. **Business Agility**: Enables rapid deployment of new notification types without modifying consuming systems
6. **Customer Engagement**: Provides insights into communication effectiveness and engagement patterns
7. **Cross-Selling Opportunity**: Creates touchpoints for targeted marketing and cross-selling
8. **Cost Optimization**: Consolidated communication channels reduce per-message costs

## Core Concepts

### 1. Notification

A message or alert sent to a recipient through one or more channels, containing relevant information about a business event, update, or action required.

### 2. Notification Template

A structured format defining the content, layout, and presentation of a notification, with placeholders for dynamic data insertion.

### 3. Notification Channel

A medium through which notifications are delivered to recipients, such as email, SMS, push notification, in-app message, or physical mail.

### 4. Notification Preference

A recipient's explicit choices regarding which notifications to receive, through which channels, and at what frequency.

### 5. Delivery Status

The current state of a notification within its lifecycle, tracking whether it has been sent, delivered, opened, or acted upon.

### 6. Notification Campaign

A coordinated series of notifications sent to a group of recipients for a specific purpose, often with sequential or triggered logic.

### 7. Personalization

The process of tailoring notification content to individual recipients based on their characteristics, behavior, or preferences.

### 8. Communication Digest

A compilation of multiple notifications into a single message to reduce communication frequency while maintaining information delivery.

## Business Rules

### Notification Creation and Scheduling

1. All notifications must be associated with a specific notification type defined in the system
2. Every notification must have a clearly identified recipient with a valid delivery endpoint
3. Critical notifications (e.g., food safety alerts, delivery confirmations) must have delivery guarantees and fallback channels
4. Non-critical notifications may be batched and delivered according to recipient preference
5. Marketing notifications must respect opt-in status for the specific marketing category
6. All notifications must have a defined expiry time after which delivery attempts should cease
7. Notifications must be scheduled according to recipient timezone where known
8. Multiple notifications of the same type to the same recipient within a short time window must be consolidated

### Template Management

1. All notification templates must be version-controlled with audit history
2. Templates must support multi-language content with consistent variable placeholders
3. Template content must adhere to brand guidelines and accessibility standards
4. Legal-required content (e.g., unsubscribe links, company address) must be included in appropriate templates
5. All templates must pass content validation before activation
6. Template placeholders must have default values for fallback when personalization data is unavailable
7. Templates must support responsive design when delivered to channels that support it
8. Critical notification templates must be approved by both business and legal stakeholders

### Channel Selection and Delivery

1. Channel selection must follow recipient preferences when available
2. Critical notifications must attempt delivery through at least two channels if primary fails
3. Delivery through regulated channels (e.g., SMS) must comply with time-of-day restrictions
4. Channel capacity limitations must be honored (e.g., SMS character limits, email size)
5. Channel-specific formatting requirements must be automatically applied
6. Secondary channel delivery must only occur after primary channel failure or timeout
7. Cost-optimal channel selection must be used for non-critical communications
8. Channel provider failover must occur automatically when primary provider fails

### Personalization and Content

1. Personalized content must be sanitized to prevent injection vulnerabilities
2. Personalization must respect recipient's preferred language when available
3. All personalization variables must be validated before insertion into templates
4. Personally identifiable information must be minimized in notification content
5. Product information in notifications must be current at time of delivery
6. Pricing information must include applicable currency and tax disclaimer
7. Links in notifications must use tracking parameters where analytics are required
8. Images in notifications must have appropriate alt text and fallback content

### Preference Management

1. Recipients must be able to update notification preferences through a self-service interface
2. Preference changes must take effect within 24 hours of submission
3. Mandatory notifications (e.g., account security, recall notices) cannot be disabled by recipients
4. Preference options must be grouped logically by notification category
5. Unsubscribe requests must be honored immediately across all relevant categories
6. New notification types must default to opt-out for marketing and opt-in for operational communications
7. Preference history must be maintained for compliance and dispute resolution
8. Global communication stops ("do not contact") must override all optional notification types

### Delivery Tracking and Analytics

1. All notification attempts must be logged with timestamp, channel, and status
2. Delivery confirmations must be captured when supported by the channel
3. Notification open/engagement metrics must be tracked where technically possible
4. Failed deliveries must generate appropriate retry or escalation based on notification priority
5. Aggregate delivery statistics must be maintained by notification type and channel
6. Engagement trends must be analyzed to optimize notification strategy
7. Delivery failures exceeding threshold percentages must trigger alerts
8. A/B testing of notification content must maintain consistent measurement methodology

### Compliance and Privacy

1. All notifications must include required regulatory content for their classification
2. Consent records must be maintained for marketing communications with timestamp and source
3. Personal data included in notifications must be minimized and aligned with privacy policy
4. Retention periods for notification content and delivery records must align with data policies
5. Geographic communication regulations must be enforced based on recipient location
6. Sensitive product categories (e.g., alcohol) must follow additional notification restrictions
7. Internal notifications containing customer data must be appropriately classified and secured
8. Data subject access requests must include notification history within scope
