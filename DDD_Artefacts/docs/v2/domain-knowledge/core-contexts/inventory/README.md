# Inventory Management Domain

## Domain Overview

The Inventory Management domain is responsible for tracking, controlling, and optimizing the stock of specialty food products throughout Elias Food Imports' supply chain. This domain handles inventory levels, warehouse management, batch tracking, expiration date monitoring, and inventory forecasting. It serves as a critical component that ensures product availability while minimizing waste, particularly important for specialty food items that often have limited shelf life, special storage requirements, and varying seasonal availability.

The current implementation of the Inventory Management domain has been identified as having significant gaps, particularly in batch/expiration tracking, temperature-controlled storage management, and forecasting capabilities for perishable items. This document outlines the comprehensive domain model for Inventory Management with a focus on addressing these gaps to better support Elias Food Imports' specialty food business.

## Strategic Importance

**Classification**: Core Domain

**Justification**: The Inventory Management domain is classified as a core domain for Elias Food Imports because effective inventory management of specialty food products represents a significant competitive advantage in the market. The ability to maintain optimal inventory levels of premium, often perishable products while ensuring quality, freshness, and authenticity directly impacts customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and profitability. The specialized requirements of food inventory management—including batch tracking, expiration monitoring, temperature control, and regulatory compliance—make this domain a key differentiator for Elias Food Imports rather than a commodity function.

## Core Concepts

### Inventory Item

The basic unit of inventory tracking, representing a specific product at a specific location with attributes including quantity, status, and storage conditions.

### Inventory Batch

A group of inventory items that share common characteristics such as production date, expiration date, supplier, and quality attributes, allowing for precise tracking and management of product lifecycle.

### Storage Location

A physical or logical location where inventory is stored, including attributes such as temperature range, humidity level, and storage capacity, critical for maintaining food quality.

### Inventory Reservation

A temporary allocation of inventory that prevents it from being assigned to other orders or processes, ensuring availability during customer checkout or other operations.

### Inventory Movement

A record of inventory changing location, status, or ownership within the system, providing a complete audit trail of product flow.

### Expiration Tracking

The monitoring and management of product expiration dates to ensure food safety, minimize waste, and optimize inventory rotation.

### Temperature Control

The monitoring and management of storage temperatures for products requiring specific temperature ranges to maintain quality and safety.

### Inventory Forecast

Predictions of future inventory levels based on historical data, seasonality, promotions, and other factors to optimize purchasing and production planning.

### Quality Control

The processes and checks that ensure inventory meets quality standards, including sensory evaluation, laboratory testing, and compliance verification.

### Inventory Allocation

The assignment of specific inventory to fulfill customer orders or other business needs, often following FIFO (First In, First Out) or FEFO (First Expired, First Out) principles.

## Business Rules

### Inventory Tracking and Management

1. All inventory items must be associated with a specific storage location and product SKU.
2. Inventory levels must be updated in real-time when products are received, allocated, shipped, or adjusted.
3. Negative inventory is not permitted; inventory operations that would result in negative quantities must be rejected.
4. Each inventory transaction must be recorded with timestamp, user, quantity, reason code, and reference information.
5. Inventory counts must be reconciled with physical counts at least weekly for high-value items and monthly for standard items.
6. Inventory accuracy must be maintained at ≥ 99.9% as measured by physical inventory counts.
7. Inventory adjustments exceeding $500 in value require manager approval and documentation.
8. Real-time inventory visibility must be provided to all relevant stakeholders, including sales, purchasing, and fulfillment teams.

### Batch and Expiration Management

1. All perishable products must be tracked at the batch level with production and expiration dates.
2. Inventory allocation must follow FEFO (First Expired, First Out) principles for perishable items.
3. System must generate alerts for products approaching expiration: 30 days, 14 days, and 7 days before expiration.
4. Products that have reached 75% of their shelf life must be flagged for potential promotional pricing.
5. Expired products must be automatically quarantined and not available for sale.
6. Batch information must include supplier, country of origin, production date, and any applicable certification information.
7. Complete batch traceability must be maintained from supplier to customer for food safety and recall management.
8. Batch sampling protocols must be defined and executed for quality assurance purposes.

### Temperature-Controlled Inventory

1. Products must be stored in locations with appropriate temperature ranges as defined in their product specifications.
2. Temperature-controlled storage locations must be continuously monitored with alerts for out-of-range conditions.
3. Temperature excursions must be logged with duration and magnitude to assess product quality impact.
4. Cold chain compliance must be maintained and documented throughout the receiving, storage, and shipping processes.
5. Products exposed to temperature excursions must be evaluated by quality control before being made available for sale.
6. Temperature logs must be maintained for regulatory compliance and quality assurance for a minimum of 3 years.
7. Different temperature zones (ambient, refrigerated, frozen) must be clearly defined with appropriate inventory segregation.
8. Temperature-sensitive products must be labeled with appropriate handling instructions.

### Inventory Reservations

1. Inventory reservations are created when items are added to a shopping cart with a default duration of 30 minutes.
2. Reservations are automatically extended during active cart sessions.
3. Expired reservations are automatically released back to available inventory.
4. Reservations are converted to allocations when an order is placed.
5. Reservation conflicts must be resolved with priority given to completed orders over cart reservations.
6. Reservation status must be visible to customer service and sales teams.
7. Bulk reservations for B2B customers may have extended durations based on customer agreements.
8. Reservation capacity must not exceed 25% of available inventory for any SKU to prevent artificial stockouts.

### Inventory Forecasting and Planning

1. Inventory forecasts must be generated weekly for a 12-week forward horizon.
2. Forecast accuracy must be measured and maintained at ≥ 85% for A-category items.
3. Seasonal patterns must be incorporated into forecast algorithms for specialty food items.
4. Safety stock levels must be dynamically calculated based on demand variability, lead time, and service level targets.
5. Reorder points must trigger purchase recommendations automatically.
6. Slow-moving inventory (no movement in 60 days) must be flagged for review.
7. Forecast models must incorporate promotional events, seasonality, and historical sales patterns.
8. Inventory optimization must balance service levels (target ≥ 98%) with inventory carrying costs.

### Quality Control and Compliance

1. All received inventory must pass quality inspection before being made available for sale.
2. Quality control samples must be taken from each batch according to the sampling plan.
3. Products failing quality checks must be quarantined pending supplier resolution.
4. All quality control results must be recorded and linked to the specific inventory batch.
5. Regulatory compliance documentation must be maintained for each product batch.
6. Allergen control protocols must be followed for storage location assignments to prevent cross-contamination.
7. Recall procedures must enable identification and quarantine of affected batches within 2 hours of notification.
8. Quality metrics must be tracked and reported monthly, including rejection rates and quality incidents.

## Implementation Recommendations

### Architecture

1. **Microservice Architecture**: Implement the Inventory Context as a dedicated microservice with its own database to ensure scalability and isolation.
2. **Event-Driven Communication**: Use an event-driven architecture for communication between contexts, with a robust message broker (e.g., Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ) to ensure reliable event delivery.
3. **CQRS Pattern**: Implement Command Query Responsibility Segregation to separate read and write operations, optimizing for both high-volume inventory transactions and complex queries.
4. **Domain-Driven Design**: Structure the implementation following DDD principles with clear boundaries between aggregates and strong enforcement of invariants.

### Technical Implementation

1. **Database**:
   - Use a relational database for core inventory transactions to ensure ACID compliance
   - Consider time-series database for temperature monitoring data
   - Implement optimistic concurrency control for inventory operations

2. **API Design**:
   - RESTful APIs for synchronous operations
   - GraphQL for complex inventory queries
   - Asynchronous APIs using webhooks for long-running processes

3. **Batch Processing**:
   - Implement batch processing for inventory counts, adjustments, and reconciliation
   - Use idempotent operations to prevent duplicate processing

4. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Cache inventory levels with appropriate invalidation strategies
   - Implement read-through and write-through caching for high-volume SKUs

### Scalability and Performance

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Design the service to scale horizontally for increased load, particularly during peak seasons.
2. **Partitioning Strategy**: Partition inventory data by warehouse or product category to improve performance.
3. **Query Optimization**: Implement specialized read models for common inventory queries.
4. **Background Processing**: Move non-critical operations to background jobs to maintain responsiveness.

### Data Quality and Resilience

1. **Data Validation**: Implement strict validation rules for all inventory operations.
2. **Audit Trail**: Maintain a comprehensive audit trail of all inventory changes.
3. **Reconciliation Process**: Implement automated reconciliation between physical counts and system records.
4. **Disaster Recovery**: Design robust backup and recovery procedures with point-in-time recovery capability.

### Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Core inventory tracking and batch management
   - Basic inventory operations (receive, adjust, allocate)
   - Batch tracking and expiration management
   - Integration with Order and Catalog contexts

2. **Phase 2**: Advanced inventory capabilities
   - Temperature monitoring system
   - Reservation system
   - Integration with Shipping and Purchasing contexts

3. **Phase 3**: Optimization and intelligence
