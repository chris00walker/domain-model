# Catalog Authentication Context

## 1. Domain Overview

The Catalog Authentication context is responsible for verifying the authenticity and provenance of specialty food products in the Elias Food Imports catalog. This bounded context handles the end-to-end authentication process, from scanning product authentication markers to maintaining provenance records and handling counterfeit detection.

## 2. Strategic Importance

This bounded context represents a **core domain** for Elias Food Imports as it directly addresses the primary business differentiator: guaranteed authenticity of specialty imported food products. The authentication system builds customer trust and protects brand reputation by ensuring products are genuine imports from their claimed origin.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Authentication Scan
A process where a product's authentication markers are verified through physical, digital, or blockchain means.

### Provenance Record
Complete history of a product from originating producer through the supply chain to Elias Food Imports.

### Authentication Marker
Physical or digital element on product packaging that can be validated (QR code, hologram, NFC tag).

### Verification Status
The current authentication state of a product (Verified, Failed, Pending, Quarantined).

### Counterfeit Detection
Processes and algorithms for identifying potentially counterfeit products.

## 4. Business Rules

1. All imported products must have at least one verifiable authentication marker
2. Authentication scans must be logged with timestamp, location, and operator information
3. Failed authentication requires immediate quarantine status and investigation
4. Verified products must maintain a complete, immutable provenance record
5. Authentication success rate must remain above 99.5% for operational excellence
6. Counterfeit detection must achieve 98% or higher detection rate
7. Products in "Quarantine" status cannot be made available for sale

## 5. Domain Events

| Event | Description | Consumers |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| `ProductAuthenticated` | Product has passed authentication checks | Catalog, Inventory |
| `AuthenticationFailed` | Product failed authentication verification | Inventory, Notification |
| `ProductQuarantined` | Product placed in quarantine pending investigation | Inventory, Reporting |
| `ProvenanceVerified` | Completed verification of product's full supply chain | Catalog, Marketing |
| `CounterfeitDetected` | System has identified a potential counterfeit product | Notification, Reporting |

## 6. Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects

### Aggregates
- **AuthenticationRecord**: Root entity managing the verification process and results

### Entities
- **ProvenanceRecord**: Entity tracking supply chain history
- **AuthenticationMarker**: Entity representing verification markers on products
- **QuarantineCase**: Entity for products requiring investigation

### Value Objects
- **VerificationStatusVO**: Typed enumeration of authentication statuses
- **AuthenticationScore**: Numeric representation of verification confidence
- **MarkerType**: Types of supported authentication technologies
- **QuarantineReasonVO**: Reason for product quarantine

## 7. Domain Services

- **AuthenticationService**: Core service for verifying product authenticity
- **ProvenanceService**: Service for tracing product origins and handling
- **CounterfeitDetectionService**: Specialized service for identifying suspect products

## 8. Integration Points

### Upstream Contexts
- Receives product information from **Catalog** context
- Receives inventory updates from **Inventory** context

### Downstream Contexts
- Sends verification results to **Catalog** context
- Triggers inventory status updates in **Inventory** context
- Provides authentication reporting to **Analytics** context
- Sends counterfeit alerts to **Notification** context

## 9. Implementation Recommendations

1. Implement blockchain-based verification for immutable provenance records
2. Develop mobile authentication app for in-warehouse scanning
3. Implement machine learning-based counterfeit detection
4. Create dashboards for authentication metrics and success rates
5. Deploy automated quarantine workflows tied to inventory management

## Business Success Metrics

- Authentication scan success rate ≥ 99.5%
- Counterfeit detection rate ≥ 98%
- Average authentication processing time < 2 seconds
- Provenance record completeness ≥ 99.8%
- Zero verified counterfeits reaching customers
