# Shopping Cart Domain

<!-- GAP_IMPLEMENTED: Dedicated Cart Context -->
<!-- stub for "Dedicated Cart Context" gap in the shopping-cart context -->

## Domain Overview

The Shopping Cart domain is responsible for managing the temporary storage and manipulation of products that customers intend to purchase from Elias Food Imports. This domain handles the pre-order phase of the customer journey, allowing customers to collect products, modify quantities, apply promotional codes, and initiate the checkout process. The Shopping Cart domain serves as a critical bridge between product browsing and order creation, enabling a seamless transition from product selection to purchase commitment.

Currently, cart functionality is embedded within the Order context rather than existing as a separate bounded context, which has been identified as a significant gap in the domain model. This document outlines the proposed implementation of a dedicated Shopping Cart context to address this gap.

## Strategic Classification

**Classification**: Supporting Domain

**Justification**: While the Shopping Cart domain is essential to the customer experience and directly impacts conversion rates, it primarily serves to facilitate the core Order domain by preparing the necessary data for order creation. It is a well-understood pattern in e-commerce systems with established solutions, making it a supporting domain rather than a core differentiator for Elias Food Imports.

## Core Domain Concepts

### Shopping Cart
A temporary container that holds products a customer is considering for purchase, including quantities, customizations, and pricing information.

### Cart Item
An individual product entry within a shopping cart, containing product details, quantity, pricing, and customization information.

### Cart Session
A time-bound interaction period during which a customer adds and modifies items in their cart, typically associated with a browser session or user account.

### Abandoned Cart
A shopping cart that contains items but has not been converted to an order within a defined timeframe, representing a potential recovery opportunity.

### Inventory Reservation
A temporary hold placed on inventory items when they are added to a cart, ensuring availability during the shopping session.

### Cart Recovery
The process of re-engaging customers who have abandoned their carts, typically through notifications or incentives.

### Guest Cart
A shopping cart associated with a non-authenticated user, which may later be transferred to a registered user account.

### Cart Merger
The process of combining items from a guest cart with an existing cart when a user logs in.

## Business Rules

<!-- GAP_IMPLEMENTED: Cart Reservation System -->
<!-- stub for "Cart Reservation System" gap in the shopping-cart context -->

### Cart Creation and Management

1. A shopping cart is automatically created when a customer adds their first product.
2. Each cart must be associated with either a registered user or a guest session.
3. Cart sessions expire after 72 hours of inactivity for guest users.
4. Registered users' carts persist indefinitely until checkout or explicit removal.
5. A user can have only one active cart at a time.
6. When a guest user logs in, their cart items must be merged with any existing cart for that user.
7. Maximum number of unique products in a cart is limited to 50 items.

### Cart Items and Inventory

1. Adding an item to the cart must check product availability before confirming addition.
2. Items added to the cart create a temporary inventory reservation for 30 minutes.
3. Inventory reservations are automatically extended during active cart sessions.
4. If a product becomes unavailable while in the cart, the customer must be notified.
5. For perishable products, estimated shelf life information must be displayed in the cart.
6. Products with special handling requirements (refrigeration, fragile) must be flagged in the cart.
7. Cart items requiring authentication must display verification status.

### Pricing and Promotions

1. Product prices in the cart reflect the price at the time of addition.
2. Price changes during the session must be highlighted to the customer.
3. Promotional codes can be applied to the entire cart or specific eligible items.
4. Multiple promotions can be applied if they don't conflict with each other.
5. The system must automatically apply the most advantageous combination of promotions.
6. Volume discounts must be automatically calculated based on quantity.
7. Currency conversion rates for international customers must be updated in real-time.
8. B2B customers may see different pricing based on their organization tier.

### Cart Interactions

1. Quantity changes must validate against inventory and maximum order constraints.
2. Removing an item releases its inventory reservation.
3. Customers can save items for later, moving them from the active cart to a wishlist.
4. The cart must recalculate totals after any modification.
5. Estimated shipping costs and delivery dates must be displayed based on cart contents.
6. Tax calculations must be performed based on shipping destination and product categories.
7. For international orders, customs and import fees estimates must be provided.

### Abandoned Cart Recovery

1. Carts are considered abandoned after 4 hours of inactivity with items present.
2. Abandoned cart recovery emails can be sent at 4, 24, and 48-hour intervals.
3. Recovery incentives (discounts, free shipping) can be offered based on cart value.
4. Abandoned cart analytics must track recovery rate and effectiveness of incentives.
5. Registered users' abandoned carts must be visible when they log in again.
6. Abandoned cart recovery must respect customer communication preferences.

### Checkout Process

1. Initiating checkout must verify all items are still available.
2. Inventory reservations are extended during the checkout process.
3. Cart contents are locked during checkout to prevent concurrent modifications.
4. Failed checkout attempts must return the customer to an editable cart state.
5. Successful checkout converts the cart to an order and releases the cart session.
6. After checkout, the cart data must be preserved for analytics but marked as converted.
