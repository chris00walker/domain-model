## 1. Domain Overview

The Customer Domain manages all aspects related to customers in the Elias Food Imports (EFI) system. It handles different types of customers, their contact information, preferences, relationships with the business, and segmentation strategies that drive marketing and sales efforts.

## 2. Strategic Importance

The Customer Domain is a core domain for Elias Food Imports as it:

1. **Enables Personalization**: Allows tailoring of product offerings and communications based on customer segments and preferences

## Implementation Recommendations

### Architecture Recommendations

1. **CQRS Pattern**: Implement Command Query Responsibility Segregation to separate read and write operations
   - Commands: Customer creation, updates, segment changes
   - Queries: Customer profiles, segment lists, analytics views
   
2. **Event Sourcing**: Consider event sourcing for customer data to maintain complete history
   - Event store should capture all state changes
   - Snapshots at regular intervals for performance
   - Event replay capabilities for audit and recovery

3. **Microservices Approach**:
   - Core Customer Service: Customer CRUD operations
   - Segmentation Service: Segment analysis and assignment
   - Loyalty Service: Points and rewards management
   - Customer Insights Service: Analytics and recommendations

4. **Data Storage Strategy**:
   - Primary customer data: Document database (MongoDB/CosmosDB)
   - Customer search: Elasticsearch for complex querying
   - Customer analytics: Data warehouse with dimensional model
   - Historical events: Append-only event store

### Technical Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Cache frequently accessed customer profiles
   - Implement segmentation calculation as background process
   - Consider read replicas for high-traffic customer lookup operations
   - Segment bulk operations for large customer data updates

2. **Security Requirements**:
   - Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data
   - Role-based access control for customer data
   - Audit logging for all customer data access
   - Compliance with data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
   - Data retention policies and purging mechanisms

3. **Integration Patterns**:
   - Domain Event Publication: Kafka/RabbitMQ for event distribution
   - Synchronous APIs: REST/GraphQL for direct queries
   - Customer Data Sync: CDC (Change Data Capture) for real-time updates
   - Segment Webhooks: Push notifications for segment changes

4. **Resilience Patterns**:
   - Circuit breakers for integration points
   - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Fallback strategies for dependency failures
   - Graceful degradation of non-critical features

### Priority Implementations

1. **Phase 1 (Immediate)**:
   - Core Customer domain model implementation
   - Basic segmentation capabilities
   - Essential domain events
   - Critical integration points (Order, Subscription)
   
2. **Phase 2 (3-6 months)**:
   - Advanced segmentation algorithms
   - Loyalty program implementation
   - Customer insight generation

3. **Phase 3 (6-12 months)**:
   - Predictive analytics integration
   - Customer journey mapping
   - Machine learning recommendation engine
   - Customer Segment Webhooks for external system integration
   - 360-degree customer view

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Domain model validation rules
   - Segmentation calculation logic
   - Loyalty point calculations
   - Value object immutability

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Event publication and consumption
   - API contract validation
   - Database persistence operations
   - Cache interaction

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Large customer base segmentation performance
