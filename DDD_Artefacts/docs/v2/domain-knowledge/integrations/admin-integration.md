# Admin Integration Pattern

## Overview
This document defines the Admin integration pattern for Elias Food Imports' eCommerce system. Following modern DDD best practices, Admin functionality is **not** modeled as a separate bounded context but rather as:

- A cross-cutting **composite UI layer** with dedicated UI components
- A **Backend for Frontend (BFF)** that routes administrative requests
- **Context-specific administrative capabilities** residing within each relevant bounded context

This pattern maintains clean bounded context boundaries while providing a cohesive administrative experience.

## Admin Architecture Pattern

### Admin Portal (UI Layer)
- A unified administrative interface built using React (consistent with the MERN stack)
- Organized as a collection of domain-specific admin modules (e.g., Catalog Admin, Order Admin)
- Provides dashboards, configuration interfaces, and workflow management screens
- Implements consistent UI patterns for administrative tasks across all domains
- Ensures proper role-based access control visualization for administrative functions
- Aggregates notifications and alerts from all bounded contexts

### Admin BFF (Application Layer)
- Routes administrative commands to appropriate bounded contexts
- Aggregates data from multiple contexts for administrative dashboards
- Enforces cross-cutting concerns like authentication, authorization, and audit logging
- Provides a unified API surface for the Admin Portal
- Handles API versioning and backward compatibility for the admin interface
- Implements caching strategies for frequently accessed administrative data
- Manages session state and admin user context

### Context-Specific Admin Services (Domain Layer)
- Each bounded context exposes its own administrative capabilities
- Domain models remain focused on core business rules
- Admin-specific application services handle administrative operations
- System configuration APIs are exposed by relevant contexts:
  - `FeatureFlagService`: Managing feature flags and toggles
  - `ComplianceSettingService`: Configuring compliance-related parameters
  - `NotificationConfigurationService`: Setting up notification rules
  - `WorkflowConfigurationService`: Defining workflow rules and thresholds
- Administrative read models provide specialized views for admin dashboards
- Context-specific validation and authorization rules enforce domain integrity

## Integration with Other Contexts

### Identity and Access Management Context
- Authentication of administrative users
- Role and permission management for administrative functions
- Admin audit logging and compliance reporting
- Session management and security policies

### All Domain Contexts 
Each bounded context must implement:
- Admin-specific application services for administrative operations
- Admin-specific queries and read models for dashboards and reporting
- Admin-specific domain events for audit trails and cross-context coordination

> **Note:** See Review & Marketing contexts for content-moderation workflows and implementation details.

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Define admin capabilities in each bounded context's documentation
2. Implement context-specific admin APIs with proper authorization checks
3. Create the Admin BFF as a lightweight orchestration layer
4. Build the Admin Portal as a modular, composite interface
5. Ensure all administrative actions emit appropriate domain events
6. Implement comprehensive audit logging for all administrative operations
7. Design for progressive enhancement of admin capabilities over time
