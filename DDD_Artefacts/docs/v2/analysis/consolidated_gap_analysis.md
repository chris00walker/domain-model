# Domain Model Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive gap analysis of the domain model, combining both business and technical perspectives. It identifies gaps by comparing the implementation against a standard eCommerce reference model, analysis of perishable goods requirements, and technical analysis of the current implementation.

## Analysis Methodology

Gaps were identified through multiple approaches:

1. **Reference Model Comparison**: Comparing the implementation against a standard eCommerce reference model
2. **Perishable Goods Analysis**: Reviewing requirements specific to perishable food and beverage e-commerce
3. **DDD Pattern Analysis**: Evaluating implementation against DDD best practices for complex domains
4. **Scenario Stress-Testing**: Walking through common user journeys to identify unsupported steps
5. **Source Code Inspection**: Direct examination of the implementation in `/DDD_Artefacts/src`
6. **Documentation Review**: Analysis of documentation in `/DDD_Artefacts/docs/v2`
7. **Context Mapping Analysis**: Identifying missing integrations between bounded contexts

## Gap Assessment Framework

Each gap is evaluated using the following criteria:

- **Severity**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Business Impact**: Direct impact on business capabilities
- **Implementation Complexity**: Effort required to address the gap
- **Food-Specific Considerations**: Special considerations for food distribution and perishable goods

## Gap Analysis

This section documents the identified gaps in the domain model, organized by priority level.

### 1. Perishable Goods Management

**Priority**: Critical

**Description**: Limited support for managing perishable goods with expiration dates and batch tracking

**Business Perspective**:

- **Impact**:
  - Risk of selling expired products
  - Inefficient inventory rotation (FIFO/FEFO)
  - Regulatory compliance risks
  - Increased waste from expired goods
- **Food-Specific Considerations**: Critical for food safety and quality assurance
- **Severity**: Critical

**Technical Perspective**:

- **Current State**:

  - Basic inventory tracking exists
  - No built-in support for batch/lot tracking
  - No expiration date management
  - Limited quality control workflows

- **Required Components**:
  - Batch/Lot tracking with expiration dates
  - FEFO (First-Expired-First-Out) picking logic
  - Quality control workflows
  - Automated expiration scanning
  - Quarantine capabilities for suspect inventory

**Implementation Recommendation**:

- Implement Batch aggregate with expiration tracking
- Add FEFO picking strategy to Inventory domain
- Create quality control workflows for receiving and storage
- Implement automated expiration scanning service

### 2. Cold Chain Monitoring

**Priority**: High

**Description**: No support for temperature monitoring and cold chain compliance

**Business Perspective**:

- **Impact**:
  - Risk of product spoilage
  - Regulatory compliance issues
  - Customer health and safety concerns
  - Brand reputation risk
- **Food-Specific Considerations**: Essential for maintaining food safety and quality
- **Severity**: High

**Technical Perspective**:

- **Current State**:

  - No temperature monitoring
  - No cold chain breach detection
  - Limited quality event tracking

- **Required Components**:
  - Temperature monitoring service
  - Cold chain breach detection
  - Quality event tracking
  - Automated alerting system

**Implementation Recommendation**:

- Create ColdChainMonitoring bounded context
- Integrate with IoT temperature sensors
- Implement breach detection and alerting
- Add quality event tracking to Inventory

### 3. Shopping Cart Domain

**Priority**: Critical

**Description**: Missing dedicated shopping cart context in the domain model

**Business Perspective**:

- **Impact**:
  - Inability to support standard eCommerce workflows
  - Missed opportunities for cart recovery and analytics
  - Reduced customer experience during product selection
- **Food-Specific Considerations**: Critical for managing limited-availability specialty items
- **Severity**: Critical

**Technical Perspective**:

- **Current State**:

  - No ShoppingCart class or aggregate exists in the codebase
  - Order domain creates Orders directly without a cart intermediary
  - References to "basket credit" relate only to subscription benefits
  - No Cart-to-Order conversion process exists

- **Required Components**:
  - Cart aggregate (with CartItems)
  - Cart persistence and timeout policies
  - Cart-to-Order conversion process
  - Inventory reservation policies for carted items
  - Cart abandonment tracking and recovery mechanisms

**Implementation Recommendation**:

- Create a ShoppingCart bounded context or place it within the Order domain
- Implement clear integration points to Catalog, Pricing, and Customer contexts
- Add inventory reservation system to prevent overselling

### 4. Advanced DDD Patterns

**Priority**: High

**Description**: Missing implementation of advanced DDD patterns for complex domain logic

**Business Perspective**:

- **Impact**:
  - Reduced ability to model complex business rules
  - Harder to maintain and evolve the domain model
  - Limited support for cross-context consistency
- **Food-Specific Considerations**: Important for handling complex food safety and quality rules
- **Severity**: High

**Technical Perspective**:

- **Current State**:

  - Basic DDD patterns implemented
  - Limited use of domain events
  - No explicit domain services
  - Limited value object usage

- **Required Components**:
  - Comprehensive domain event model
  - Domain services for cross-aggregate logic
  - Rich value objects for domain concepts
  - Explicit aggregate boundaries

**Implementation Recommendation**:

- Implement comprehensive domain event model
- Create domain services for cross-aggregate logic
- Refactor to use value objects for domain concepts
- Document aggregate boundaries and consistency rules

### 5. Batch and Expiration Management

**Priority**: High

**Description**: Inadequate support for batch-level tracking and expiration management

**Business Perspective**:

- **Impact**:
  - Inefficient inventory management
  - Increased risk of expired stock
  - Limited traceability for recalls
- **Food-Specific Considerations**: Critical for food safety and regulatory compliance
- **Severity**: High

**Technical Perspective**:

- **Current State**:

  - Basic inventory tracking
  - No batch-level tracking
  - No expiration date management

- **Required Components**:
  - Batch aggregate with expiration tracking
  - FEFO picking strategy
  - Automated expiration scanning
  - Quarantine capabilities

**Implementation Recommendation**:

- Implement Batch aggregate with expiration tracking
- Add FEFO picking strategy to Inventory
- Create expiration scanning service
- Implement quarantine workflow for expired/suspect inventory

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1 (Critical)**: Implement Batch and Expiration Management

   - Add Batch aggregate with expiration tracking
   - Implement FEFO picking strategy
   - Create expiration scanning service

2. **Phase 2 (High Priority)**: Cold Chain Monitoring

   - Implement temperature monitoring service
   - Add cold chain breach detection
   - Create quality event tracking

3. **Phase 3 (High Priority)**: Shopping Cart Domain

   - Implement ShoppingCart aggregate
   - Add cart persistence and timeout policies
   - Implement cart-to-order conversion

4. **Phase 4 (Medium Priority)**: Advanced DDD Patterns
   - Implement comprehensive domain event model
   - Create domain services for cross-aggregate logic
   - Refactor to use value objects for domain concepts

## Conclusion

This gap analysis identifies several critical areas for improvement in the domain model, particularly around perishable goods management and cold chain monitoring. Addressing these gaps will significantly improve the system's ability to handle the complexities of food e-commerce while maintaining high standards of food safety and quality.
