# Domain Model Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive gap analysis of the domain model, combining both business and technical perspectives. It identifies gaps by comparing the implementation against a standard eCommerce reference model and through technical analysis of the current implementation.

## Analysis Methodology

Gaps were identified through multiple approaches:

1. **Reference Model Comparison**: Comparing the implementation against a standard eCommerce reference model
2. **Scenario Stress-Testing**: Walking through common user journeys to identify unsupported steps
3. **Source Code Inspection**: Direct examination of the implementation in `/DDD_Artefacts/src`
4. **Documentation Review**: Analysis of documentation in `/DDD_Artefacts/docs/v2`
5. **Context Mapping Analysis**: Identifying missing integrations between bounded contexts

## Gap Assessment Framework

Each gap is evaluated using the following criteria:

- **Severity**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Business Impact**: Direct impact on business capabilities
- **Implementation Complexity**: Effort required to address the gap
- **Food-Specific Considerations**: Special considerations for food distribution

## Gap Analysis

This section documents the identified gaps in the domain model, organized by priority level.

### Shopping Cart Domain

**Priority**: Critical

**Description**: Missing dedicated shopping cart context in the domain model

**Business Perspective**:

- **Impact**:
  - Inability to support standard eCommerce workflows
  - Missed opportunities for cart recovery and analytics
  - Reduced customer experience during product selection
- **Food-Specific Considerations**: Critical for managing limited-availability specialty items
- **Severity**: Critical

**Technical Perspective**:

- **Current State**:
  - No ShoppingCart class or aggregate exists in the codebase
  - Order domain creates Orders directly without a cart intermediary
  - References to "basket credit" relate only to subscription benefits
  - No Cart-to-Order conversion process exists

- **Required Components**:
  - Cart aggregate (with CartItems)
  - Cart persistence and timeout policies
  - Cart-to-Order conversion process
  - Inventory reservation policies for carted items
  - Cart abandonment tracking and recovery mechanisms

**Implementation Recommendation**:
- Create a ShoppingCart bounded context or place it within the Order domain
- Implement clear integration points to Catalog, Pricing, and Customer contexts
- Add inventory reservation system to prevent overselling
