# Elias Food Imports Domain Model Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive gap analysis between the standard eCommerce Reference Model and Elias Food Imports' current domain model implementation. The analysis identifies areas where EFI's model diverges from or lacks elements present in the reference model, assesses the business impact of these gaps, and provides recommendations for addressing them with consideration for EFI's specialty food distribution business.

## Methodology

The analysis compares each bounded context defined in the eCommerce Reference Model against EFI's implementation, examining:

1. Domain concepts and entities
2. Business rules and processes
3. Integration patterns and relationships
4. Food distribution-specific considerations

Each gap is evaluated based on:
- **Severity**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Business Impact**: Direct impact on business capabilities
- **Implementation Complexity**: Effort required to address the gap
