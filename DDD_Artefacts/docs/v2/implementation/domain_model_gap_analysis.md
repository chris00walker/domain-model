# Domain Model Gap Analysis

This document identifies and analyzes gaps in the current domain model, based on scenario stress tests, business requirements review, and source code inspection. Each gap is prioritized based on its impact on business functionality and technical feasibility.

## Analysis Methodology

Gaps were identified using multiple approaches:

1. **Scenario Stress-Testing**: Walking through common user journeys to identify unsupported steps
2. **Source Code Inspection**: Direct examination of the implementation in `/DDD_Artefacts/src`
3. **Documentation Review**: Analysis of documentation in `/DDD_Artefacts/docs/v2`
4. **Context Mapping Analysis**: Identifying missing integrations between bounded contexts

## Critical Gaps

### 1. Shopping Cart Domain (CRITICAL)

**Description**: The domain model lacks a Shopping Cart aggregate/entity and the associated processes entirely.

**Current Implementation**:

- No ShoppingCart class or aggregate exists in the codebase
- Order domain creates Orders directly without a cart intermediary
- Documentation mentions "cart abandonment" metrics but doesn't define cart behavior
- References to "basket credit" in the code relate only to subscription benefits, not shopping carts
- No Cart-to-Order conversion process exists

**Business Impact**:

- Customers cannot temporarily store items before purchasing
- Unable to handle cart abandonment analytics (though metrics for them are referenced)
- No mechanism for cart-based promotions
- Missing critical step in customer journey from browsing to checkout

**Required Concepts**:

- Cart aggregate (with CartItems)
- Cart persistence and timeout policies
- Cart-to-Order conversion process
- Inventory reservation policies for carted items
- Cart abandonment tracking
- Cart recovery mechanisms

**Affected Domains**:

- Ordering
- Pricing
- Catalog
- Customer

**Implementation Recommendation**:
Create a ShoppingCart bounded context or place it within the Order domain with clear integration points to Catalog (product availability), Pricing (discount application), and Customer (saved carts).

### 2. Inventory Reservation System (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Description**: Model lacks a well-defined inventory reservation system, particularly for transient cart reservations.

**Current Implementation**:

- No visible concurrency control for inventory in the codebase
- No protection against race conditions where multiple users might purchase limited stock
- No temporal reservation system for products added to cart (cart doesn't exist)
- No backorder or pre-order capabilities found

**Business Impact**:

- Potential race conditions causing overselling of limited inventory
- No temporal reservation for items in cart during shopping session
- Unclear reservation expiration policies
- Missing backorder capabilities
- Risk of customer disappointment if items show as available but cannot be purchased

**Required Concepts**:

- Inventory lock mechanism (optimistic or pessimistic concurrency)
- Reservation entity with expiration
- Reservation release policies
- Concurrency control
- Backorder functionality

**Affected Domains**:

- Inventory
- Order
- Shopping Cart (once implemented)

**Implementation Recommendation**:
Implement reservation capabilities within the Inventory domain with clear integration to Order and Shopping Cart domains. Consider using a distributed lock pattern or event-sourced reservation system to handle concurrent access.

### 3. Return & Refund Process (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Description**: The model lacks return and refund handling processes.

**Current Implementation**:

- RefundPolicyVO exists in the ordering domain, but not tied to a Return entity/process
- No Return aggregate or entity is defined in the codebase
- No integration between refunds and inventory restocking
- No documentation of return processes

**Business Impact**:

- No formalized way to handle customer returns
- Unclear inventory impact of returned items
- No mechanism for partial order returns
- Missing refund processing for returned items
- Customer service limitations for handling post-purchase issues

**Required Concepts**:

- Return aggregate with return reason and status
- ReturnItem entity for line item returns
- Return policy application (building on existing RefundPolicyVO)
- Refund processing with multiple payment methods
- Inventory restocking process for returned items

**Affected Domains**:

- Order
- Payment
- Inventory
- Customer

**Implementation Recommendation**:
Create a Return subdomain within the Order domain with clear processes for requesting, approving, and processing returns and refunds, extending the existing RefundPolicyVO.

### 4. Order Status Lifecycle (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Description**: Order state transitions for edge cases are not fully defined.

**Current Implementation**:

- Order aggregate exists with status transitions (Created, Paid, Fulfilled, Cancelled)
- OrderPaymentFailed event exists but handling is incomplete
- No admin-initiated modifications to orders implemented
- Missing handling for partial fulfillment scenarios

**Business Impact**:

- Unclear handling of failed payments during checkout
- No defined process for admin order modifications
- Missing order editing capabilities
- Incomplete handling of partial shipments and backorders

**Required Concepts**:

- Comprehensive order state machine (extending current implementation)
- More robust payment failure handling
- Order modification events and validation
- Cancellation policies and inventory impact
- Partial fulfillment tracking

**Affected Domains**:

- Order
- Payment
- Inventory
- Shipping

**Implementation Recommendation**:
Enhance the Order domain with a complete state machine and corresponding domain events for all possible state transitions, building on the existing implementation.

### 5. Customer Registration & Authentication (LOW PRIORITY)

**Description**: Account creation flow and authentication not fully specified.

**Current Implementation**:

- Customer domain exists with basic functionality
- No explicit registration flow documented or implemented
- No guest checkout vs. registered user distinction

**Business Impact**:

- Incomplete customer onboarding process
- Guest checkout vs registered user distinction unclear
- Account management features incomplete

**Required Concepts**:

- User registration process
- Authentication workflow
- Guest checkout handling
- Account lifecycle management

**Affected Domains**:

- Customer
- Authentication

**Implementation Recommendation**:
Enhance Customer and Authentication domains with explicit workflows for registration and authentication.

## Implementation Prioritization

Based on the identified gaps and their business impact, we recommend the following implementation order:

1. **Shopping Cart Domain** (CRITICAL) - Fundamental for e-commerce functionality
2. **Inventory Reservation System** (HIGH) - Prevents overselling and race conditions
3. **Return & Refund Process** (HIGH) - Critical for customer service
4. **Order Status Lifecycle** (MEDIUM) - Ensures complete order processing
5. **Customer Registration & Authentication** (LOW) - Enhances user experience

## Next Steps

1. Review this gap analysis with business stakeholders
2. Incorporate high-priority gaps into the implementation roadmap
3. Develop detailed specifications for the Shopping Cart domain
4. Schedule regular scenario stress tests to identify additional gaps
5. Update the Domain Event Catalog to include events for the new functionality
6. Extend the Ubiquitous Language guide to define cart-related terminology
