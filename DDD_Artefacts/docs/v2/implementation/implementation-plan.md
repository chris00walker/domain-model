# Elias Food Imports Implementation Plan

This document outlines the prioritized implementation plan for Elias Food Imports domain model enhancements, focusing on business-value features in order of strategic importance.

## Implementation Approach

All implementations will follow established DDD patterns including:

1. Domain model extensions with appropriate aggregates, entities, and value objects
2. Core domain services with well-defined interfaces
3. API endpoints for external integration
4. Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, and acceptance)
5. Documentation updates to reflect new capabilities
