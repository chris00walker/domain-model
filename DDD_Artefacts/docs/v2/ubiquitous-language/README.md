# Ubiquitous Language Framework

This document serves as the central hub for the Ubiquitous Language Consistency Framework for Elias Food Imports. 

**The single authoritative source for all domain terms is [`guides/glossary.md`](./guides/glossary.md).**

This framework provides a comprehensive approach to maintaining terminology consistency across all aspects of the domain model.

## Framework Components

### 1. Core Guidelines

- [Ubiquitous Language Guidelines](./guides/ubiquitous_language_guidelines.md) - Foundational principles and standards
- [Ubiquitous Language Evolution Process](./guides/ubiquitous_language_evolution.md) - How the language evolves over time
- [Domain Glossary](./guides/glossary.md) - Authoritative definitions of all domain terms (single source of truth)
### 2. Implementation Guides

- [Ubiquitous Language in API Design](./implementation-guides/api_design.md) - Applying ubiquitous language to API design
- [Ubiquitous Language in Database Design](./implementation-guides/database_design.md) - Database naming and structure conventions
- [Ubiquitous Language in UI Design](./implementation-guides/ui_design.md) - Consistent terminology in user interfaces
- [Ubiquitous Language in Testing](./implementation-guides/testing.md) - Writing tests that reflect the domain language

### 3. Analysis Documents

- [Domain Terms in Requirements Analysis](./analysis/domain-terms-requirements.md) - Ensuring requirements use consistent terminology
- [Domain Event Naming Analysis](./analysis/domain_event_naming.md) - Conventions for naming domain events
- [Terminology Alignment Guide](./analysis/terminology_alignment.md) - Aligning terms across contexts

### 4. Business Integration

- [Business Metrics Domain Mapping](./business-integration/business_metrics_domain_mapping.md) - Connecting business metrics to domain concepts
- [Ubiquitous Language Onboarding](./business-integration/onboarding_program.md) - Training for new team members
## Using This Framework
### For Developers
1. **Starting a New Feature**:
   - Begin with the [Ubiquitous Language Guidelines](./guides/ubiquitous_language_guidelines.md)
   - Review relevant domain terms in your context
2. **Implementing Domain Concepts**:
   - Use the implementation guides for your specific area
   - Ensure alignment with existing terminology
### For Product Managers
1. **Writing Requirements**:
   - Reference [Domain Terms in Requirements Analysis](./analysis/domain-terms-requirements.md)
   - Use consistent terminology from the domain model
### For Domain Experts
1. **Evolving the Language**:
   - Follow the [Ubiquitous Language Evolution Process](./guides/ubiquitous_language_evolution.md)
   - Document changes and rationale
### For New Team Members
1. **Onboarding**:
   - Start with [Ubiquitous Language Onboarding](./business-integration/onboarding_program.md)
   - Review the glossary for your specific bounded context
## Governance
The Ubiquitous Language Framework is maintained by the DDD Implementation Team with input from domain experts and stakeholders. Any changes to core terminology must follow the evolution process and be documented appropriately.
