# ADR-009: Data Protection Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Elias Food Imports deals with sensitive customer data, payment information, and proprietary supplier data that must be protected according to various regulations (GDPR, PCI DSS, CCPA) and business requirements. As a food import business with international operations, we need a comprehensive approach to data protection that:

- Ensures compliance with multiple international regulations
- Protects customer Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
- Secures payment data according to industry standards
- Safeguards proprietary business information and trade secrets
- Enables data portability and the right to be forgotten
- Supports audit requirements and forensic analysis
- Maintains data integrity throughout the system

## Decision
We will implement a multi-layered **Data Protection Strategy** with the following components:

1. **Data Classification Framework**:
   - Personal Data: Customer information subject to privacy regulations
   - Payment Data: Card details, bank information subject to PCI DSS
   - Business Data: Proprietary information, pricing strategies, supplier agreements
   - Operational Data: Order history, inventory levels, non-sensitive business metrics

2. **Encryption Approach**:
   - In-Transit Encryption: TLS 1.2+ for all network traffic
   - At-Rest Encryption: AES-256 for all sensitive personal and payment data
   - Database-Level Encryption: Transparent Data Encryption for database files
   - Column-Level Encryption: For specific high-sensitivity fields (e.g., authentication tokens)

3. **Access Control Implementation**:
   - Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for complex authorization scenarios
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for administrative functions
   - Field-Level Security for sensitive data columns
   - Just-In-Time Access for exceptional access requirements

4. **Data Retention Policies**:
   - Customer Data: Retained while account is active plus regulatory period
   - Payment Data: Minimal storage period required for business operations
   - Operational Data: Time-boxed retention with automated archiving
   - Audit Logs: Minimum 2-year retention with secure archive

5. **Privacy by Design Implementation**:
   - Data Minimization: Collect only necessary data
   - Purpose Limitation: Clear documentation of data usage
   - Data Subject Rights: Technical implementation of access, correction, deletion
   - Pseudonymization: For analytical processing where possible

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets requirements across multiple jurisdictions
- **Customer Trust**: Demonstrates commitment to data protection
- **Risk Reduction**: Minimizes potential impact of breaches
- **Operational Clarity**: Clear guidelines for handling different data types
- **Audit Readiness**: Facilitates compliance verification

### Negative
- **Implementation Complexity**: Multiple layers of protection add technical complexity
- **Performance Impact**: Encryption and access controls may impact system performance
- **Development Overhead**: Additional requirements for new features
- **Operational Costs**: Monitoring and maintaining security controls requires resources
- **Integration Challenges**: May complicate third-party integrations

### Mitigations
- Automated testing for security controls to reduce development burden
- Caching strategies to minimize performance impact of encryption
- Security frameworks and libraries to standardize implementation
- Clear documentation and developer training on data protection requirements
- Regular security reviews and penetration testing
