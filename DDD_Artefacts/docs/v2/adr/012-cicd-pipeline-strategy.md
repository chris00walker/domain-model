# ADR-012: CI/CD Pipeline Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Elias Food Imports requires a robust software delivery process that enables:

- High development velocity with quality assurance
- Consistent deployment across environments
- Reliable and repeatable release processes
- Early detection of integration issues
- Enforcement of security and compliance requirements
- Automated testing at multiple levels
- Support for domain-driven design principles
- Traceability from requirement to production deployment

The team has been experiencing challenges with manual deployment processes, inconsistent environments, and lengthy testing cycles that delay delivery of business value and increase risk of errors.

## Decision
We will implement a **CI/CD Pipeline Strategy** with the following components:

1. **Pipeline Stages and Gates**:
   - **Continuous Integration**: Build, unit tests, static analysis
   - **Validation**: Integration tests, contract tests, security scans
   - **Deployment**: Environment promotion (dev → staging → production)
   - **Verification**: Post-deployment tests, smoke tests, monitoring

2. **Pipeline Implementation**:
   - GitHub Actions as primary CI/CD platform
   - Configuration-as-Code for pipeline definitions
   - Reusable workflow templates for common patterns
   - Build artifacts stored in GitHub Packages

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Unit tests for domain logic and application services
   - Integration tests for infrastructure adapters
   - Contract tests for service boundaries
   - End-to-end tests for critical business flows
   - Performance tests for key transactions
   - Security scans (SAST, DAST, SCA)

4. **Environment Management**:
   - Environment-specific configuration via environment variables
   - Infrastructure as Code for environment provisioning
   - Feature flags for controlled rollout
   - Blue/Green deployment for zero-downtime updates

5. **Quality and Security Gates**:
   - Minimum code coverage requirements (80% for domain model)
   - Security vulnerability scanning (dependencies and code)
   - Pull request reviews with at least one approval
   - Static analysis enforcement (linting, code smells)
   - Branch protection for main/production branches

6. **Release Management**:
   - Semantic versioning for all releases
   - Automated release notes generation
   - Deployment windows for production changes
   - Rollback mechanisms for failed deployments
   - Post-deployment validation

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Faster Delivery**: Automation reduces manual steps and waiting time
- **Higher Quality**: Consistent testing reduces defects reaching production
- **Reduced Risk**: Small, incremental changes are easier to troubleshoot
- **Better Collaboration**: Visibility into the pipeline promotes shared ownership
- **Governance**: Automatic enforcement of standards and policies
- **Traceability**: Clear audit trail from code change to deployment
- **Developer Experience**: Streamlined workflow with fast feedback loops

### Negative
- **Initial Setup Cost**: Building comprehensive pipelines requires upfront investment
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Pipeline definitions require ongoing maintenance
- **Potential Bottlenecks**: Tests and scans can slow down delivery if not optimized
- **Tool Lock-in**: Dependencies on specific CI/CD tooling
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand pipeline principles and tools

### Mitigations
- Start with core pipeline, then incrementally add stages and gates
- Monitor pipeline execution times and optimize slow steps
- Document pipeline patterns and practices for the team
- Schedule regular reviews of pipeline efficiency
- Use abstractions to reduce direct coupling to CI/CD tools
- Invest in developer training on CI/CD principles
