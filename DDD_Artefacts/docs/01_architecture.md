| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Horizontal (Out)** | • Deploy multiple instances behind LBs. • Design contexts stateless; any instance can serve. | • Improved availability. • Enhanced throughput. |
| **Vertical (Up)** | • Increase CPU, RAM, and storage of existing instances. • Use cloud provider tools to resize. | • Immediate performance gains. • Simpler management. |
| **Auto-Scaling** | • Dynamic scaling based on real-time metrics (CPU, memory, request rate). • Scheduled scaling for predictable spikes (promotions). | • Cost efficiency. • Consistent performance. |

### 14.2 Performance Optimization {#14.2-performance-optimization}

#### Caching Mechanisms

* **In-Memory Caching**  
    
  * Tools: Redis, Memcached.  
  * Scope: Hot data (product listings, sessions).  
  * Benefit: Ultra-fast retrieval; reduced latency.


* **CDN Caching**  
    
  * Tools: Cloudflare, Akamai.  
  * Scope: Static assets (images, CSS, JS).  
  * Benefit: Lower latency via edge servers.


* **DB Query Caching**  
    
  * Implementation: Cache expensive query results at DB or application layer.  
  * Benefit: Reduces load on primary DB.


* **HTTP Response Caching**  
    
  * Strategy: Leverage `Cache-Control`, `ETag`, and `Last-Modified` headers.  
  * Benefit: Avoid redundant server processing.

#### Load Balancing

| Strategy | Description | Best Practices |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Round Robin | Distribute requests evenly across servers. | Use health checks to remove unhealthy nodes. |
| Least Connections | Route to server with fewest active connections. | Monitor connection counts to rebalance quickly. |
| IP Hashing | Maintain session affinity for specific clients. | Use sparingly to prevent hotspots. |
| Weighted | Route based on server capacity (CPU/RAM). | Adjust weights dynamically based on instance health. |
| SSL Termination | Offload TLS at the LB to reduce backend CPU load. | Ensure certificates auto-renew (Let’s Encrypt, ACM). |
| Redundancy | Multiple LB instances to avoid single point of failure. | Configure LB with multiple AZs and cross-region failover. |

#### Performance Monitoring

* **Metrics Collection**  
    
  * Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, New Relic.  
  * Monitored Items: CPU, memory, latency, request rate.

## 15\. System Architecture Overview {#15.-system-architecture-overview}

### 15.1 Architectural Style {#15.1-architectural-style}

#### Headless Architecture

* **Definition:**  
    
  * Decouple frontend (presentation) from backend (business logic).  
  * Communication exclusively via APIs (REST/gRPC).


* **Rationale:**  
    
  * **Flexibility:** Multiple frontend clients (web, mobile, IoT) use same backend.  
  * **Scalability:** Frontend/backends scale independently.  
  * **Agility:** Separate teams can deploy independently.  
  * **Enhanced UX:** Modern frontend frameworks like React/Next.js.  
  * **Future-Proofing:** Easier to swap frontend technologies.


* **Impact on Design:**  
    
  * **API-Centric**: All interactions happen via well-documented APIs.  
  * **Independent Deployment:** Frontend and backend are separate deployable units.  
  * **Technology Agnosticism:** Use best-of-breed frameworks per layer.

#### Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) Modular Monolith

* **Definition:**  
    
  * Core domain is isolated via “ports” (interfaces).  
  * “Adapters” implement those ports for persistence, messaging, and UI.


* **Modular Monolith Pattern:**  
    
  * Single deployable unit composed of loosely coupled bounded contexts.  
  * Contexts communicate via synchronous calls or domain events.


* **Advantages:**  
    
  * **Simplified Operations:** One deployable artifact reduces orchestration complexity.  
  * **Domain Integrity:** Bounded contexts encapsulate cohesive functionality.  
  * **Testability:** Domain logic tests run without external dependencies.  
  * **Development Velocity:** Teams work on separate contexts with clear contracts.  
  * **Evolutionary Design:** Incremental refactoring possible without widespread disruption.


* **Integration with Headless:**  
    
  * **Primary Adapters:** HTTP controllers (Fastify) and message consumers for headless clients.  
  * **Event Bus:** RabbitMQ for event-driven interactions.  
  * **Unified API Design:** Consistent, versioned APIs simplify frontend integration.  
  * **Benefits:** Enhanced modularity, simplified testing, resilience via circuit breakers and fallbacks.

#### Notes

* Each context folder (`catalog/`, `orders/`, etc.) contains its own `tests/` subfolder with:  
    
  * `tests/unit/`: Unit tests for domain and application services.  
  * `tests/integration/`: Integration tests using real adapters (DB, message bus).


* Top-level `tests/e2e/` holds end-to-end specs (e.g., “user registers → browses catalog → places order → completes payment”).  
    
* `shared/tests/unit/` contains unit tests for shared utilities (UUID generator, base DTO validators).

### Summary

* Architectural style is a headless front end \+ hexagonal modular monolith back end.  
* System overview table clarifies each component and its technology.  
* Folder structure co-locates code and tests within each bounded context.
