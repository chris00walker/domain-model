## ADR-007: Hexagonal Modular Monolith Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Elias Food Imports needs an architecture that balances:

- Development velocity and simplicity
- Team autonomy and focus on distinct business domains
- Future scalability and potential for service extraction
- Maintainability and testability concerns
- Cross-domain consistency requirements

A key architectural decision was required to define how the system would be structured to meet these requirements while supporting the domain-driven design principles adopted by the organization.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt a **Hexagonal Modular Monolith** architecture with the following characteristics:

1. **Bounded Context Organization**:
   - Code is organized into distinct bounded contexts (Catalog, Orders, Customers, Payments, etc.)
   - Each bounded context represents a distinct domain model with its own ubiquitous language

2. **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)** within each bounded context:
   - Core domain logic is isolated from external concerns
   - Domain use cases are exposed via ports (interfaces)
   - Adapters handle technical concerns: persistence, UI, external integrations
   - Clear separation between domain model, application services, and infrastructure

3. **Modular Design**:
   - Explicit and controlled dependencies between contexts
   - Shared kernel for cross-cutting concerns
   - Each module can be tested in isolation
   - Strong encapsulation of implementation details

4. **Initially Monolithic Deployment**:
   - Single deployable application for simplified operations
   - Shared database with schema separation by bounded context
   - Common infrastructure for cross-cutting concerns

5. **Service Extraction Readiness**:
   - Design interfaces to support future microservice extraction
   - Domain events for asynchronous communication between contexts
   - Clear boundaries to enable independent scaling of high-traffic components

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Reduced Initial Complexity**: Single deployment unit simplifies operations
- **Simplified Data Consistency**: Transactions can span contexts when necessary
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared codebase facilitates knowledge sharing
- **Controlled Refactoring**: Bounded contexts can be extracted to services incrementally
- **Simplified Testing**: Easier integration testing within the monolith
- **Development Velocity**: Faster initial development without distributed system complexity

### Negative

- **Risk of Boundary Erosion**: Temptation to bypass proper interfaces between contexts
- **Deployment Coupling**: All contexts must be deployed together
- **Shared Resource Contention**: Potential for one module to impact others in production
- **Governance Overhead**: Requires discipline to maintain clear module boundaries
- **Limited Independent Scaling**: Until extraction, bounded contexts share resources

### Mitigations

- Enforce strict code organization via linting rules and code reviews
- Implement interface contracts between bounded contexts with versioning
- Establish clear ownership for each bounded context
- Document and automate dependency management between contexts
- Use feature flags to control rollout of changes across contexts
