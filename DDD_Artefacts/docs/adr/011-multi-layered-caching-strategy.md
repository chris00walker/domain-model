## ADR-011: Multi-Layered Caching Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Elias Food Imports' platform faces performance and scalability challenges that impact user experience, database load, and overall system efficiency:

- Product catalog with thousands of SKUs requires fast search and browsing
- High-traffic periods during promotions and seasonal peaks
- Complex pricing calculations involving multiple factors (volume discounts, subscriptions, dynamic pricing)
- Need to support low-latency global access despite central data storage
- Database queries for common operations become performance bottlenecks
- Critical need for responsive UI across all devices

The system requires a comprehensive caching strategy that addresses these challenges while maintaining data consistency and acceptable freshness.

## Decision

We will implement a **Multi-Layered Caching Strategy** with the following components:

1. **Browser/Client-Side Caching**:
   - Cache-Control headers for static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
   - Service Workers for offline capabilities in web applications
   - Local storage for user preferences and recent interactions
   - Clear versioning strategy for cache invalidation

2. **CDN Caching**:
   - Use Cloudflare or similar CDN for edge caching
   - Cache all static assets at edge locations
   - Implement cache warming for critical assets
   - Per-resource TTL based on change frequency

3. **API Gateway Caching**:
   - Cache common API responses at the API gateway level
   - Configurable TTL based on data volatility
   - Cache-aside pattern with conditional validation
   - Support for cache key generation from request parameters

4. **Application-Level Caching**:
   - Distributed cache (Redis) for shareable application data
   - Local in-memory caches (with TTL) for very high-frequency data
   - Cached repository pattern for domain objects
   - Event-based cache invalidation for data consistency

5. **Database Query Result Caching**:
   - Query-level caching for expensive or frequent database operations
   - Materialized views for complex aggregate queries
   - Read replicas for read-heavy operations
   - Custom caching of calculated values (e.g., dynamic pricing)

6. **Cache Management and Consistency**:
   - Domain event listeners for cache invalidation
   - Distributed cache invalidation for multi-node deployment
   - Cache versioning for atomic updates
   - Monitoring of cache hit/miss rates and performance impact

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Improved Response Times**: Significant latency reduction for end users
- **Reduced Database Load**: Lower pressure on database systems
- **Higher Scalability**: Better handling of traffic spikes
- **Lower Costs**: Reduced infrastructure requirements for the same load
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Faster page loads and interactions
- **Global Performance**: Consistent experience regardless of user location

### Negative

- **Implementation Complexity**: Multiple caching layers require careful coordination
- **Data Consistency Challenges**: Risk of stale data if invalidation fails
- **Cache Invalidation Overhead**: Additional processing for change detection
- **Development Overhead**: Requires cache-aware development practices
- **Debugging Complexity**: Harder to track issues when data flows through multiple caches

### Mitigations

- Comprehensive cache monitoring and analytics
- Automatic cache TTL enforcement as a fallback for missed invalidations
- Clear cache management documentation and developer guidelines
- Cache warming strategies for cold starts
- Circuit breakers to handle cache unavailability
- Regular cache efficiency reviews
