# ADR-010: Observability & Monitoring Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Elias Food Imports platform requires comprehensive visibility into system behavior, performance, and health to ensure:

- Early detection of issues before they impact customers
- Deep understanding of system performance and behavior
- Support for debugging complex distributed interactions
- Validation of business KPIs and technical SLAs
- Proactive identification of potential improvements
- Capacity planning based on usage patterns
- Security monitoring and anomaly detection

As we're implementing a modular monolith with future plans for potential service extraction, we need a robust observability strategy that will support both current and future architecture needs.

## Decision
We will implement a comprehensive **Observability & Monitoring Strategy** with the following components:

1. **Three Pillars of Observability**:
   - **Metrics**: Quantitative measurements of system behavior and performance
   - **Logs**: Detailed records of events and state changes
   - **Traces**: End-to-end tracking of requests through system components

2. **Technical Implementation**:
   - **Metrics Collection & Visualization**:
     - Prometheus for metrics collection and alerting
     - Grafana for dashboards and visualizations
     - Custom instrumentation of key business processes
   
   - **Centralized Logging**:
     - Structured logging with JSON format
     - ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log aggregation
     - Standard log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL)
     - Correlation IDs in all logs for request tracking
   
   - **Distributed Tracing**:
     - OpenTelemetry for instrumentation
     - Jaeger or Zipkin for request-flow visualization
     - Sampling strategy based on request importance

3. **Key Monitoring Areas**:
   - **Technical Metrics**:
     - Infrastructure: CPU, memory, disk I/O, network
     - Application: Request rates, latency, error rates, queue depths
     - Database: Query performance, connection pool utilization
   
   - **Business Metrics**:
     - Order volume and processing time
     - Customer acquisition and retention
     - Cart abandonment rates
     - Search effectiveness
     - Revenue and transaction metrics

4. **Alerting & Incident Response**:
   - SLO-based alerting thresholds
   - Alert routing based on service ownership
   - Defined incident severity levels
   - Automated runbooks for common issues
   - On-call rotation schedules

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Issue Detection**: Earlier detection and resolution of problems
- **Performance Insights**: Clear visibility into system bottlenecks
- **Debugging Efficiency**: Reduced MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution)
- **Business Alignment**: Technical metrics tied to business outcomes
- **Capacity Planning**: Data-driven infrastructure scaling decisions
- **SLA Management**: Objective measurement of system reliability

### Negative
- **Implementation Overhead**: Requires additional development effort for instrumentation
- **Data Volume**: Large volumes of telemetry data require storage and management
- **Alert Fatigue**: Risk of excessive alerts leading to team burnout
- **Privacy Considerations**: Need to ensure PII is not exposed in logs or metrics
- **Performance Impact**: Some instrumentation may add minor overhead

### Mitigations
- Standard instrumentation libraries to reduce implementation burden
- Sampling strategies for high-volume telemetry data
- Regular review and tuning of alerting thresholds
- Automated PII detection and redaction in logs
- Performance testing to ensure minimal overhead from instrumentation
