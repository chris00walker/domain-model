# **🎯 Goal:** Design and prioritise the *channels* that move each **Phase 1 Prioritise segment** from **Attraction → Awareness → Consideration → Confidence → Exchange → Post-Exchange**, while respecting the CAC and margin guardrails in the master *Value Proposition Analysis (VPA)*.

**Strategyzer Lens:** Every channel must

1. Reach the right segment at the right journey stage,

2. Honour that segment’s jobs/pains/gains, and

3. Be linked to a **Desirability (D) experiment card** on the *Testing Business Ideas* (TBI) board.

## **3 │ Channel Design Rationale (Strategyzer Lens)**

1. **Segment Fit:** Diaspora & Expats engage on Facebook & WhatsApp; Food-Trucks seek menu inspo on Instagram; Mini-Markets follow trade publications.

2. **Jobs & Pains:** WhatsApp bot instantly answers “Is it Halal?” (pain ✓); QR demo soothes authenticity anxiety (gain ✓).

3. **Cost Harmony:** CAC ≤ BBD 20 (B2C) and ≤ BBD 50 (B2B) align with VPA margin targets; footnoted formula ensures transparency.

4. **Fail-Safe:** If the B2B portal slips past M7 or has \> 3 defects, the manual [Order](../ubiquitous-language/glossary.md#order) form keeps revenue flowing.

5. **Post-Exchange Nurture:** WhatsApp drips deliver tips and cross-sells, driving repeat orders and higher LTV.

6. **Experiment-Ready:** Every row links to its TBI card so teams can launch and measure experiments without friction.

## **4 │ KPI Dashboard (Channel Layer)**

* **B2C:** CAC, AOV, sessions→purchase, [Subscription](../ubiquitous-language/glossary.md#subscription) churn, NPS

* **B2B:** Lead-to-quote ratio, quote-to-[Order](../ubiquitous-language/glossary.md#order), CAC payback orders, reorder cycle

* **Cross-channel:** Marketing spend as % of GMV ≤ 8 % (Phase 1 target)

## **5 │ Next Steps**

1. Populate each 🔗 placeholder with the actual Desirability experiment card link.

2. Sync with Finance to bake the CAC formula (**CAC \= (Ad \+ Creative \+ Sales labour) / New Accounts**) into your dashboards.

3. Implement the manual [Order](../ubiquitous-language/glossary.md#order)-form fail-safe for Phase 1B.

4. Build and schedule the Post-Exchange WhatsApp drip workflow.

5. Review and adjust CAC thresholds after the first Channel experiment.
