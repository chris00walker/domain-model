This document specifies maintainability quality attributes—codebase health, documentation, testing, and operational processes—for the Elias Food Imports platform.



## Code Maintainability

- **Modular Architecture:** code organised by bounded context with clear interfaces.
- **Coding Standards:** ESLint for JS/TS, PEP 8 for Python; enforced in CI.
- **Inline Documentation:** JSDoc / Sphinx for complex logic with examples.
- **Regular Refactoring:** Allocate 10 % of each sprint to technical-debt reduction; follow Boy-Scout Rule.
- **Version Control Practices:** GitFlow or trunk-based; protected branches; PR reviews with at least one approver.
- **Code Reviews & Static Analysis:** SonarQube / CodeQL run on every PR.

## Documentation Standards

- Maintain architecture (C4), OpenAPI specs, data models and user guides.
- Markdown templates with front-matter metadata (title, date, version).
- Hosted on MkDocs with search; PDF export for offline use.
- Docs owners per module; updates required for “Definition of Done”.

## Automated Testing

- ≥ 90 % unit-test coverage; integration tests for critical workflows.
- Test suites run on every commit; merges blocked on failures.
- Load tests (k6, Gatling) monthly in staging; regression suite nightly.
- Test reports generated; Slack/email alerts on critical failures.


> High maintainability reduces total cost of ownership, accelerates delivery cycles, and facilitates onboarding for new team members.
