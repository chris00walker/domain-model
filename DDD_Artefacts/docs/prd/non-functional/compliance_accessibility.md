# Compliance & Accessibility Requirements

## Regulatory Compliance

- **Data Protection (GDPR & CCPA):** data minimisation; explicit opt-in/opt-out; honour subject-rights requests (access, correction, deletion ≤ 30 days).
- **Payment Security (PCI DSS):** no storage of full card data; tokenisation; quarterly ASV scans; annual penetration tests.
- **Consumer Protection:** display return policies, shipping costs and taxes before checkout; no hidden fees.
- **Industry Certifications:** pursue ISO-27001 and SOC 2; display seals on site once certified.
- **Audit Trails:** retain logs of consents, data access and system changes ≥ 1 year.
- **Policy Updates:** review regulatory changes quarterly; update policies and platform controls within 30 days.

## Accessibility Standards

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:** meaningful alt text, semantic HTML elements, captions/transcripts for media.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** all interactive elements operable via keyboard (Tab, Space, Enter).
- **Screen Reader Support:** ARIA labels/roles; announce dynamic updates (e.g., "Item added to cart").
- **Contrast & Visibility:** text contrast ≥ 4.5:1; support font resizing up to 200 % without loss of functionality.
- **Accessible Forms:** explicit `<label>` tags; descriptive error messages with `aria-describedby`.
- **Testing & Validation:** automated checks (axe-core, Lighthouse) on each build; bi-annual manual audits with assistive tools.

## AI-Driven Compliance Monitoring

- **Real-Time Policy Checks:** AI agents scan data flows (PII handling, payment transactions) and flag deviations instantly.
- **Anomaly Detection:** ML models detect unusual data-access patterns (e.g., bulk export to unauthorised endpoints).
- **Automated Reporting & Enforcement:** daily dashboards of violations; auto-anonymise data or revoke consents when breaches detected.
- **Continuous Model Updates:** refresh compliance models monthly with latest policy rules.
