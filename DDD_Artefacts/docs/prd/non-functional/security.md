## Data Encryption

- Encrypt data at rest with **AES-256** and in transit with **TLS 1.2+**.
- Keys managed in **HashiCorp Vault**; rotate quarterly.

## Vulnerability Management

- Weekly dependency scans (Snyk) with SLA: High-severity issues fixed ≤ 7 days.
- Quarterly penetration tests; critical findings patched ≤ 14 days.

## Compliance & Privacy

- GDPR and PCI-DSS scope; maintain RoPA and DPA artefacts.
- PII fields encrypted and masked in logs (see `pii_encryption_required: true`).


> Implementing these security controls mitigates risk, ensures compliance, and protects customer trust and corporate reputation.
