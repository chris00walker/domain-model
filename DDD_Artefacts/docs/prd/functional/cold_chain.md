# Cold Chain Monitoring

## Overview
The Cold Chain Monitoring system ensures the integrity of temperature-sensitive products throughout the supply chain. This module is critical for maintaining product quality, ensuring food safety, and meeting regulatory requirements for perishable goods.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Temperature Monitoring
- **Real-time Monitoring**
  - Continuous temperature tracking across all cold chain stages
  - Support for multiple temperature zones (frozen, chilled, ambient)
  - Configurable sampling frequency based on product requirements

- **Alerting & Notifications**
  - Immediate alerts for temperature excursions
  - Escalation workflows for critical violations
  - Multi-channel notifications (SMS, email, in-app)

### 2. Equipment Management
- **Device Management**
  - Register and manage temperature monitoring devices
  - Track device calibration and maintenance schedules
  - Monitor device battery life and connectivity status

- **Storage Unit Management**
  - Map temperature zones within storage facilities
  - Configure temperature setpoints and acceptable ranges
  - Document equipment maintenance and validation

### 3. Shipment Monitoring
- **Pre-Shipment Checks**
  - Verify equipment functionality before dispatch
  - Confirm temperature stability before loading
  - Document pre-cooling procedures

- **In-Transit Monitoring**
  - Real-time GPS and temperature tracking
  - Door opening/closing detection
  - Route deviation alerts

## Domain Events

### Temperature Events
- `TemperatureExcursion`: Temperature outside acceptable range
- `TemperatureStabilized`: Temperature returns to acceptable range
- `EquipmentFailure`: Monitoring device malfunction
- `CalibrationRequired`: Device calibration due

### Shipment Events
- `ShipmentTemperatureReady`: Pre-shipment temperature check passed
- `ShipmentInTransit`: Shipment has departed
- `ShipmentDelayed`: Delivery delay detected
- `ShipmentCompleted`: Successful delivery with temperature integrity

## Integration Points

### Internal Integrations
- **Inventory Management**: Flag temperature-sensitive products
- **Order Management**: Include temperature requirements in shipping instructions
- **Quality Control**: Trigger quality holds for temperature violations
- **Batch Tracking**: Correlate temperature data with specific batches

### External Integrations
- **Logistics Providers**: Share real-time temperature data
- **Regulatory Systems**: Report temperature compliance data
- **Customer Portals**: Provide temperature history to customers

   - Support 10,000+ concurrent monitoring points
   - Maintain 99.9% data capture rate

2. **Reliability**
   - 24/7/365 monitoring capability
   - Local data buffering during connectivity issues
   - Automatic failover for monitoring systems

3. **Compliance**
   - Support for regulatory requirements (FDA, HACCP, GDP)
   - Audit trail of all temperature data and modifications
   - Data retention according to regulatory guidelines
