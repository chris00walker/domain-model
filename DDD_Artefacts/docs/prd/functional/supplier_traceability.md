# Supplier Traceability

## Overview
The Supplier Traceability module provides end-to-end visibility into the supply chain, enabling tracking of products from source to consumer. It supports compliance with food safety regulations, quality assurance, and supply chain risk management through comprehensive traceability capabilities.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Supplier Management
- **Supplier Onboarding**
  - Capture detailed supplier information and certifications
  - Document supplier facilities and production capabilities
  - Manage supplier risk assessments and approvals
  - Track supplier performance metrics

- **Compliance Management**
  - Track regulatory requirements by product and region
  - Manage supplier certifications and audit reports
  - Monitor compliance with food safety standards (FSMA, GFSI, etc.)
  - Document country of origin and ethical sourcing information

### 2. Product Traceability
- **Lot/Batch Tracking**
  - Record lot/batch numbers for all received goods
  - Link incoming materials to supplier production lots
  - Track transformation of raw materials into finished goods
  - Maintain full genealogy of product transformations

- **Document Management**
  - Store and manage certificates of analysis (CoA)
  - Track safety data sheets (SDS)
  - Manage product specifications and technical data sheets
  - Archive supplier documentation with version control

### 3. Supply Chain Visibility
- **Chain of Custody**
  - Track custody transfers throughout the supply chain
  - Document handling and storage conditions
  - Record transportation details and conditions
  - Monitor temperature and environmental conditions

- **Risk Management**
  - Identify single points of failure in supply chain
  - Monitor supplier performance and risk indicators
  - Track country of origin and ethical sourcing
  - Document supplier business continuity plans

## Domain Events

### Traceability Events
- `SupplierOnboarded`: New supplier added to the system
- `ProductReceived`: Goods received from supplier with lot information
- `BatchTransformed`: Raw materials transformed into finished goods
- `ProductShipped`: Finished goods shipped to customer
- `RecallInitiated`: Product recall process started
- `TraceabilityQueryExecuted`: Traceability report generated
- `ComplianceCheckFailed`: Supplier or product out of compliance
- `SupplierPerformanceUpdated`: Supplier metrics recalculated

## Integration Points

### Internal Integrations
- **Inventory Management**: Track lot/batch movements
- **Quality Control**: Link quality data to specific lots
- **Purchasing**: Connect purchase orders to received goods
- **Production**: Track raw material usage in production
- **Sales & Distribution**: Trace products to end customers

### External Integrations
- **Supplier Portals**: Exchange traceability data
- **Regulatory Systems**: Report to food safety authorities
- **Blockchain Networks**: Share immutable traceability data
- **Industry Databases**: Verify certifications and compliance
