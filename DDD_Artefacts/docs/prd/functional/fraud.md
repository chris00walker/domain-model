# Fraud Detection & Prevention

## Transaction monitoring

**Definition:** Continuously analyze transactions to detect potential fraud.

**Key Elements:**

- **Real-time analysis:** Evaluate each transaction against rule-based and ML risk models.
- **Rule-based detection:** Flag transactions exceeding thresholds (e.g., high-value orders).
- **Machine-learning models:** Train on historical fraud data (features: velocity, geolocation, device fingerprint).
- **Risk scoring:** Assign numeric risk score; trigger manual review for high-risk cases.
- **Alerts & notifications:** Notify fraud team when transactions exceed risk thresholds.
- **Payment gateway integration:** Coordinate with gateway to place holds or decline suspicious payments.

**Benefits:**
- Reduces financial losses from fraud.
- Protects legitimate customers.

## Fraudulent activity alerts

**Definition:** Notify stakeholders when suspicious activity is detected.

**Key Elements:**

- **Automated alerts:** Instantly notify fraud prevention teams via email/SMS on high-risk transactions.
- **Customer notifications:** Inform customers if their account or transaction is flagged; request verification.
- **Incident logging:** Log all alerts, actions taken, and resolution for auditing.
- **Response workflow:** Define steps: investigation, escalation, resolution, customer communication.
- **Secure communication:** Use encrypted channels; restrict to authorized recipients.

**Benefits:**
- Speeds fraud response and resolution.
- Maintains customer trust through transparency.

## Risk assessment

**Definition:** Evaluate user and transaction risk to guide prevention.

**Key Elements:**

- **Risk metrics:** Factors: amount, velocity, IP geolocation, device anomalies.
- **Customer profiling:** Build profiles from transaction history, behavior, demographics.
- **Adaptive risk models:** Update models continuously with new fraud data.
- **Reporting:** Risk assessment reports: top risk factors, high-risk segments.
- **Domain service integration:** Coordinate with Order Management to hold orders or require extra verification.

**Benefits:**
- Improves fraud detection accuracy.
- Allocates resources to highest-risk cases.

## Anomaly detection with machine learning

**Definition:** Use ML to spot unusual patterns indicating new fraud tactics.

**Key Elements:**

- **Model training:** Train on labeled historical data to identify anomalies.
- **Real-time inference:** Serve models in production to score transactions.
- **Feature engineering:** Purchase velocity, device fingerprint, IP risk, shipping-billing mismatch.
- **Continuous learning:** Retrain models periodically with new labeled data.
- **Threshold management:** Configure risk score thresholds to balance false positives/negatives.
- **Alert integration:** Feed anomaly scores to fraud alert system for human review.

**Benefits:**
- Detects emerging fraud patterns.
- Reduces manual effort through automated scoring.
