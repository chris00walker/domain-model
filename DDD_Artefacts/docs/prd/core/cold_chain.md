  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [ ] System allows setting minimum/maximum temperature thresholds
    - [ ] Different thresholds can be set for different product types
    - [ ] Changes to thresholds require approval
  - **Dependencies**: [Product Catalog PRD]

### 3.2 Alert Management

- **FR-3**: As a logistics manager, I want to receive immediate alerts for temperature excursions so that I can take corrective action
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [ ] Alerts are generated within 30 seconds of threshold violation
    - [ ] Escalation path is followed if alerts aren't acknowledged
    - [ ] All alerts are logged with timestamps and resolutions
  - **Dependencies**: [Notification Service PRD]

- **FR-4**: As a customer service representative, I want to view temperature history for shipments so that I can address customer inquiries
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [ ] Temperature history is accessible by shipment ID
    - [ ] Reports can be generated in PDF/CSV format
    - [ ] Access is restricted based on user roles
  - **Dependencies**: [Customer Portal PRD]

## 4. Integration Points

### 4.1 Published Events

- `TemperatureExcursionDetected`
  - Payload: {deviceId, location, currentTemp, threshold, timestamp, productId, batchId}
  - Consumers: Inventory, Quality, Logistics

- `EquipmentMaintenanceRequired`
  - Payload: {deviceId, issueType, severity, lastCalibrationDate, location}
  - Consumers: Maintenance, Quality, Operations

- `ShipmentTemperatureReady`
  - Payload: {shipmentId, temperatureData, deviceId, location, timestamp}
  - Consumers: Logistics, Quality, CustomerService

### 4.2 Consumed Events

- `ShipmentCreated`
  - Source: Order Management
  - Action: Initialize temperature monitoring for shipment

- `InventoryMoved`
  - Source: Inventory Management
  - Action: Update temperature monitoring location

### 4.3 APIs/Services

- **REST/GraphQL**:
  - `GET /api/temperature/current/{location}` - Get current temperature
  - `POST /api/alerts` - Create new alert
  - `GET /api/shipments/{id}/temperature-history` - Get temperature history

- **gRPC**:
  - `TemperatureMonitoringService` - Real-time temperature data
  - `AlertService` - Alert management and notification

- **External Services**:
  - Weather data services for predictive alerts
  - Regulatory compliance reporting systems
  - Logistics partner APIs

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**:
  - Process temperature readings within 5 seconds
  - Support 50,000+ temperature data points per hour
  - Dashboard updates every 15 seconds in real-time view
