## Benefits

> Establishes consistent documentation and enables lint compliance.


The Batch Tracking module is responsible for managing the lifecycle of product batches throughout the supply chain, from receipt through to sale or disposal. This is particularly critical for perishable goods where traceability, expiration management, and quality control are essential for food safety and regulatory compliance.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Batch Creation & Management
- **Batch Creation**
  - Automatically generate unique batch/lot numbers for incoming inventory
  - Support batch splitting and merging operations
  - Associate batches with supplier information and certificates of analysis
  - Record manufacturing/packaging dates and shelf life data

- **Expiration Management**
  - Track and enforce First-Expired-First-Out (FEFO) inventory management
  - Generate alerts for batches approaching expiration
  - Support for hold/release workflows for quality control

### 2. Traceability
- **Full Traceability**
  - Track batch movement across all inventory locations
  - Maintain complete chain of custody records
  - Support one-up/one-down traceability for regulatory compliance

- **Supplier Integration**
  - Link batches to supplier certificates and documentation
  - Track country of origin and processing locations
  - Maintain audit trail of all batch status changes

### 3. Quality Control Integration
- **Quality Events**
  - Record quality inspections and test results against batches
  - Trigger quality holds based on test failures or non-conformances
  - Support for quarantine and release workflows

- **Temperature Monitoring**
  - Record and monitor temperature exposure for temperature-sensitive batches
  - Generate alerts for temperature excursions
  - Document corrective actions for temperature deviations

## Domain Events

### Batch Lifecycle Events
- `BatchCreated`: A new batch has been created
- `BatchExpired`: A batch has reached its expiration date
- `BatchQualityHold`: Batch placed on quality hold
- `BatchReleased`: Batch released from quality hold
- `BatchDisposed`: Batch disposed of due to quality or expiration

### Integration Events
- `BatchReceived`: Batch received into inventory
- `BatchAllocated`: Batch allocated to an order
- `BatchShipped`: Batch shipped to customer
- `BatchReturned`: Batch returned from customer

## Integration Points

### Internal Integrations
- **Inventory Management**: Track batch quantities across locations
- **Order Management**: Allocate specific batches to customer orders
- **Quality Control**: Trigger quality checks based on batch status
- **Supplier Management**: Link batches to supplier information

### External Integrations
- **Regulatory Systems**: Report batch information for compliance
- **Supplier Portals**: Exchange batch information with suppliers
- **Logistics Partners**: Share batch tracking information

## User Roles & Permissions

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| Warehouse Operator | View batch info, Record receipts, Perform inventory counts |
| Quality Inspector | Place batches on hold, Release batches, Record test results |
| Supply Chain Manager | Configure batch parameters, Generate reports, Manage recalls |
| Customer Service | View batch information for customer inquiries |

## Data Requirements

### Batch Master Data
- Batch/Lot number (unique identifier)
- Product reference
- Manufacturing date
- Expiration date
- Supplier information
- Country of origin
- Initial quantity
- Storage requirements

### Batch Transaction Data
- Movement history (date, from, to, quantity)
- Quality test results
- Temperature logs
- Status changes
- Associated documents (certificates, test results)

## Business Rules

1. **Batch Allocation**
   - Allocate oldest batches first (FEFO) unless overridden
   - Prevent allocation of expired or on-hold batches
   - Allow manual override with authorization

2. **Quality Management**
   - Automatic hold on receipt for inspection if required
   - Prevent shipment of quarantined batches
   - Require quality approval for release from hold

3. **Traceability**
   - Maintain complete history of all batch movements
   - Support full traceability within 4 hours for regulatory requests
   - Retain batch records for required retention period

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Support batch lookups in < 2 seconds
   - Handle 1000+ batch updates per minute
   - Support 10,000+ concurrent users

2. **Availability**
   - 99.9% uptime during business hours
   - Graceful degradation during peak loads

3. **Security**
   - Role-based access control for all batch operations
   - Audit logging of all batch status changes
   - Data encryption for sensitive batch information
