3. Synthetic orders, integration health checks, DB performance, event backlog monitoring.

## 6. Open Questions

- How should we handle partial shipments for multi-vendor orders?
- What are the specific requirements for international order processing?
- How should we handle price changes between order and fulfillment?

## 7. Out of Scope

- Product catalog management (handled by Catalog)
- Customer account management (handled by Customer)
- Warehouse management (handled by Fulfillment)
- Payment processing (handled by Payment)

## 8. Implementation Roadmap

- **Phase 3 – Advanced Features**: Returns and refunds processing, gift orders, multi-currency support.
- **Phase 4 – Optimization & Scaling**: Performance optimizations, CQRS adoption, advanced analytics and reporting.
