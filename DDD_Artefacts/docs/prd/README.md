# EFI eCommerce Platform - Product Requirements

## Overview

This directory contains Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) organized by bounded context, following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. Each PRD documents the requirements for a specific bounded context in the EFI eCommerce platform.

## Directory Structure

- `core/`: Critical business functions that provide competitive advantage
  - Example: Order Management, Inventory Management
  
- `strategic/`: Areas of strategic importance for the business
  - Example: Subscriptions, Marketing, Customer Loyalty
  
- `supporting/`: Operational capabilities that support core functions
  - Example: Shopping Cart, Product Catalog
  
- `integration/`: Cross-cutting concerns and system integrations
  - Example: Payment Processing, Shipping Integration
  
- `external/`: Third-party systems and services
  - Example: Stripe, HubSpot, ERP systems

## PRD Template

All PRDs should follow the structure in [template.md](./template.md), which includes:
- Business Context
- Domain Model
- Functional Requirements
- Integration Points
- Non-Functional Requirements
- Open Questions

## Relationship to Context Map

PRDs map to the bounded contexts defined in the [Context Map](../diagrams/context_map.puml). Each PRD should reference the corresponding context in the map and list its integration points with other contexts.

## Creating a New PRD

1. Copy `template.md` to the appropriate context directory
2. Update the metadata at the top (context, status, version, owner)
3. Fill in the sections with relevant details
4. Link to related ADRs and other artifacts
5. Add integration points to other contexts

## Documentation Structure

This documentation follows a modular structure for better maintainability and clarity. Each major component has its own dedicated documentation file.
