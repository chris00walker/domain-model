# Notifications & Alerts

[RELATED: ADR-002, ADR-004, ADR-008, ADR-009, ADR-010, ADR-011, ADR-012]
[CONTEXT: Supporting]
[STATUS: Draft]
[VERSION: 1.0.0]
[OWNER: @eng-notify]

## 1. Business Context
- **Purpose**: Deliver timely, reliable, and compliant communications across channels (email, SMS, push, in-app) for transactional notifications and operational alerts.
- **Business Capabilities**:
  - Multi-channel message dispatch with preference management
  - Severity-based alerting with escalation and suppression rules
  - Template management and localisation
  - Delivery tracking with metrics (opens, clicks, failures)
  - GDPR-compliant opt-in/out and audit logs
- **Success Metrics**:
  - Transactional message delivery success ≥ 99.5 %
  - Critical alert acknowledgement within 5 min (P95)
  - Bounce rate < 1 % for transactional email
  - Opt-out compliance 100 % within 24 h
- **Domain Experts**: CX Lead, SRE Manager, Compliance Officer, Marketing Automation Specialist

## 2. Domain Model
- **Key Entities**: `Notification`, `Channel`, `Template`, `DeliveryReceipt`, `Alert`, `EscalationPolicy`, `Preference`
- **Aggregates**:
  - `Notification` (root) → owns deliveries, receipts
  - `Alert` (root) → owns escalation state, acknowledgements
- **Value Objects**: `ChannelType`, `Severity`, `Locale`, `PreferenceSetting`
- **Domain Services**: `DispatchService`, `PreferenceService`, `EscalationService`
- **Domain Events**: `NotificationQueued`, `NotificationSent`, `NotificationFailed`, `AlertRaised`, `AlertAcknowledged`, `AlertEscalated`

## 3. Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Transactional Notifications
- **FR-1**: System queues and sends order confirmations, shipping updates, password resets.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [ ] Template resolved by locale; variables populated
    - [ ] Channel fallback (push → email) on failure

### 3.2 Preference Management
- **FR-2**: Customers manage channel & category preferences in profile.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [ ] Real-time preference validation before dispatch

### 3.3 Alerting & Escalation
- **FR-3**: Critical system events raise alerts with multi-level escalation.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [ ] Severity P1 alerts escalate to on-call after 5 min unacknowledged
    - [ ] `AlertEscalated` event emitted

### 3.4 Delivery Tracking & Analytics
- **FR-4**: Capture opens, clicks, bounces for each notification.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [ ] Metrics stored in time-series DB
    - [ ] Dashboard updated within 1 min

### 3.5 Compliance & Unsubscribe
- **FR-5**: All marketing notifications include unsubscribe link; opt-out processed immediately.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [ ] `PreferenceSetting` updated and audit event logged

### 3.6 Business Rules
- All notifications must be associated with a defined type and recipient with valid endpoint.
- Critical notifications (e.g., food safety alerts, security) require delivery guarantees and fallback channels.
- Marketing notifications must honour opt-in preference and include unsubscribe link.
- Notification retries follow exponential back-off up to 3 attempts before marked `NotificationFailed`.
- Channel capacity limits (SMS length, attachment size) must be enforced automatically.
- Secondary channel delivery only occurs after primary channel failure or timeout.
- Preference changes take effect within 24 h; mandatory notifications cannot be disabled.
- All notifications include required regulatory content; consent records retained.
- Delivery records and PII are retained per data protection policy timelines.

## 4. Integration Points
### 4.1 Published Events
- `NotificationSent` / `NotificationFailed` / `NotificationDelivered` → Consumers: AnalyticsReporting, CustomerManagement, Observability
- `AlertRaised` / `AlertEscalated` / `AlertAcknowledged` → Consumers: Observability, IncidentManagement

### 4.2 Consumed Events
- `OrderConfirmed` (OrderManagement) → Send confirmation notification
- `ShipmentCreated` (ShippingFulfillment) → Send tracking update
- `PaymentFailed` (PaymentBilling) → Notify customer & raise P2 alert
- `SubscriptionRenewalUpcoming` (Subscriptions) → Send renewal reminder
- `CustomerAccountCreated` (CustomerManagement) → Send welcome message
- `TemperatureExcursionDetected` (ColdChain) → Raise P1 alert to on-call

### 4.3 APIs/Services
- **REST**: `/notifications`, `/alerts`, `/preferences`
- **gRPC**: `DispatchService.Send` for internal modules
- **External Services**: SendGrid (email), Twilio (SMS), Firebase (push), PagerDuty (alert escalations)

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Median dispatch latency ≤ 500 ms; P95 < 2 s
- **Scalability**: 1 M notifications/day; burst 5 k/min during promotions
- **Security**: TLS 1.3; PII redacted in logs; per ADR-009
- **Reliability**: 99.99 % for transactional messages; retry with exponential backoff
- **Maintainability**: Template versioning; integration contract tests; ADR-011 caching for templates

## 6. Implementation Roadmap
### Phase 1 – Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-4)
1. Deploy event bus and basic dispatch microservice.
2. Integrate email & SMS providers with template rendering.
3. Emit `NotificationSent` / `NotificationFailed` metrics.

### Phase 2 – Preference & Template Expansion (Weeks 5-8)
1. Launch preference center with consent enforcement.
2. Add push and in-app channels and localisation support.
3. Implement delivery tracking and `NotificationDelivered` event.

### Phase 3 – Alerting & Escalation (Weeks 9-12)
1. Build severity-based alert service with PagerDuty integration.
2. Implement multi-level escalation and `AlertEscalated` logic.
3. Provide SRE dashboards & SLA alerts.

### Phase 4 – Optimisation & AI (Weeks 13-16)
1. Introduce send-time optimisation and batch digesting.
2. Integrate A/B testing and engagement analytics.
3. Harden throughput to 1 M/day with chaos testing.

## 7. Testing & Validation Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Template rendering, preference enforcement, fallback logic.
- **Integration Tests**: Provider APIs, event bus consumption, escalation workflows.
- **Performance Tests**: Burst 5 k/min dispatch with P95 < 2 s.
- **Security Tests**: Opt-out compliance, GDPR redaction, TLS enforcement.
- **User Acceptance Tests**: End-to-end order confirmation, alert escalation.
- **CI/CD Gates**: 85 % coverage, SAST, dependency scan per ADR-012.

## 8. Open Questions
- [ ] Integrate WhatsApp Business API for order updates?
- [ ] Leverage WebSockets for real-time in-app alerts?

## 9. Out of Scope
- Marketing campaign orchestration workflows (handled by Marketing context)
- Incident post-mortem generation (Observability context)
