## Terminology Harmonization Recommendations

### High Priority Harmonization Tasks

1. **Customer/User Terminology**: Standardize on "Customer" across all documentation and code, replacing instances of "User" in the Product Requirements Document.

2. **Product Structure**: Add explicit modeling for ProductCategory and ProductVariant to align with product requirements terminology.

3. **Catalog Authentication**: Implement the complete set of authentication-related terms as they are critical to the business but entirely missing from the domain model.

4. **Order Status Lifecycle**: Create an explicit OrderStatus value object with defined states that align with the events in the domain model.

5. **Subscription Components**: Add explicit modeling for SubscriptionFrequency and SubscriptionStatus to better align with business terminology.

6. **Inventory Management**: Create a proper Inventory aggregate with StockLevel and ReorderPoint value objects to align with business requirements.

7. **Payment Processing**: Add explicit Payment and Transaction entities to properly model the payment concepts mentioned in requirements.

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Update Domain Model**: Enhance the domain model with the missing entities, value objects, and services identified above.

2. **Refactor Existing Code**: Rename any misaligned terms in the codebase to match the standardized terminology.

3. **Update Documentation**: Ensure all documentation uses the standardized terminology consistently.

4. **Enhance Glossary**: Update the ubiquitous language glossary with all standardized terms and their definitions.

5. **Review with Stakeholders**: Validate the harmonized terminology with business stakeholders to ensure it accurately reflects the domain.

## Conclusion

This alignment document serves as a bridge between the business requirements and technical implementation, ensuring that the ubiquitous language is consistently applied across all artifacts. By addressing the identified gaps and inconsistencies, we can improve communication between business and technical teams, reduce misunderstandings, and ensure that the domain model accurately reflects the business domain.

# Domain Terminology Alignment Guide

## Purpose

This document provides guidance on aligning domain terminology across requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria to ensure consistency with the ubiquitous language. Consistent terminology is essential for clear communication between business stakeholders and development teams, and helps maintain the integrity of the domain model.

## Importance of Terminology Alignment

Terminology alignment is critical for several reasons:

1. **Reduced Ambiguity**: Consistent terminology reduces misunderstandings between business and technical stakeholders
2. **Improved Communication**: A shared language facilitates clearer discussions about domain concepts
3. **Better Requirements**: Well-defined terminology leads to more precise requirements
4. **Maintainable Code**: Alignment between requirements and code makes the system easier to maintain
5. **Faster Onboarding**: New team members can more quickly understand both the business domain and the codebase

## Alignment Process

### 1. Requirements Analysis

When analyzing new requirements:

1. **Identify Domain Terms**: Highlight all domain-specific terms in the requirements
2. **Check Against Glossary**: Verify each term against the ubiquitous language glossary
3. **Note Discrepancies**: Document any terms that don't match the glossary
4. **Resolve Differences**: Work with domain experts to resolve terminology differences
   - Is this a new concept that should be added to the glossary?
   - Is this an existing concept with a different name?
   - Is this a concept that spans multiple bounded contexts with different meanings?

### 2. User Story Creation

When writing user stories:

1. **Use Glossary Terms**: Always use terms from the glossary in user stories
2. **Include Term Definitions**: For key terms, include links or references to their definitions
3. **Review with Domain Experts**: Have domain experts review user stories for terminology correctness
4. **Update Acceptance Criteria**: Ensure acceptance criteria use the same terminology

### 3. Acceptance Criteria Definition

When defining acceptance criteria:

1. **Be Precise**: Use exact glossary terms in acceptance criteria
2. **Include Business Rules**: Reference relevant business rules using consistent terminology
3. **Define Metrics**: Use consistent terminology when defining success metrics
4. **Validate with Stakeholders**: Confirm that the terminology used matches stakeholders' understanding

### 4. Implementation Guidance

When implementing features:

1. **Map Requirements to Code**: Explicitly map domain terms in requirements to code elements
2. **Document Translations**: If legacy terms must be maintained, document the mapping between legacy terms and ubiquitous language
3. **Use Ubiquitous Language in Comments**: Ensure code comments use the same terminology as the requirements
4. **Apply Naming Conventions**: Follow the naming conventions defined in the ubiquitous language guidelines

## Terminology Mapping Template

For each new feature or requirement, create a terminology mapping table:

| Requirement Term | Glossary Term | Code Implementation | Notes |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| [Term used in requirement] | [Corresponding glossary term] | [Class/method/property name] | [Any special considerations] |

Example:

| Requirement Term | Glossary Term | Code Implementation | Notes |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| "Food item" | "Product" | `Product` class | Business stakeholders sometimes use "food item" informally |
| "Discount" | "Discount" | `Discount` value object | Matches glossary |
| "Shipping address" | "Delivery Address" | `DeliveryAddress` value object | Technical implementation uses glossary term |

## Common Terminology Misalignments

### Customer Context

| Common Misalignment | Correct Glossary Term | Explanation |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| "Client" | "Customer" | All buyers should be referred to as "Customers" |
| "User" | "Customer" or "System User" | Distinguish between customers and system administrators |
| "Account" | "Customer Account" | Specify the type of account for clarity |

### Subscription Context

| Common Misalignment | Correct Glossary Term | Explanation |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| "Plan" | "Subscription Plan" | Use the full term to avoid ambiguity |
| "Recurring order" | "Subscription" | Use the domain term for recurring purchases |
| "Frequency" | "Delivery Frequency" | Specify that this refers to delivery timing |

### Order Context

| Common Misalignment | Correct Glossary Term | Explanation |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| "Item" | "Line Item" | Use the full term to distinguish from products |
| "Shipping" | "Delivery" | Use "Delivery" for the process of getting products to customers |
| "Purchase" | "Order" | Use "Order" for consistency across the system |

### Pricing Context

| Common Misalignment | Correct Glossary Term | Explanation |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| "Special price" | "Promotional Price" | Use the specific term for temporary price reductions |
| "Cost" | "Cost Price" | Distinguish from other types of costs |
| "Margin" | "Gross Margin" | Specify the type of margin being calculated |

### Catalog Context

| Common Misalignment | Correct Glossary Term | Explanation |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| "Item" | "Product" | Use "Product" for items in the catalog |
| "Category" | "Product Category" | Use the full term to avoid ambiguity |
| "Stock" | "Inventory Level" | Use the specific term for quantity available |

## Terminology Review Checklist

Before finalizing requirements, user stories, or acceptance criteria, review the following:

- [ ] All domain-specific terms match the glossary
- [ ] Terms are used consistently throughout the document
- [ ] Any new terms have been reviewed with domain experts
- [ ] Any new terms have been added to the glossary if appropriate
- [ ] Acceptance criteria use the same terminology as user stories
- [ ] Success metrics use consistent terminology
- [ ] Any bounded context translations are clearly documented

## Tools and Techniques

### Terminology Highlighting

Consider using visual cues to highlight domain terminology:

- **Bold** or *italicize* domain terms in requirements
- Add glossary links to domain terms in digital documents
- Create a terminology sidebar in requirements documents

### Automated Checks

Implement automated checks for terminology consistency:

- Use linting tools to check for consistent naming in code
- Create custom checks for requirements documents
- Implement glossary validation in CI/CD pipelines

### Collaborative Glossary Maintenance

Establish a process for collaborative glossary maintenance:

- Regular glossary review sessions with domain experts
- Clear process for proposing new terms or changes
- Version control for the glossary
- Notification system for glossary changes

## Bounded Context Translation

When dealing with multiple bounded contexts:

1. **Identify Context Boundaries**: Clearly identify where terminology changes between contexts
2. **Document Context Maps**: Create explicit mappings between terms in different contexts
3. **Use Anticorruption Layers**: Implement translation layers in code where contexts interact
4. **Maintain Translation Tables**: Keep up-to-date documentation of term translations between contexts

Example context translation table:

| Term in Context A | Term in Context B | Translation Note |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| "Customer" | "Subscriber" | In the Subscription context, customers are referred to as subscribers |
| "Product" | "Subscription Item" | Products become subscription items when part of a subscription |
| "Order" | "Delivery" | In the Logistics context, orders are tracked as deliveries |

## Requirements Refactoring

When requirements use inconsistent terminology:

1. **Identify Inconsistencies**: Highlight all instances of inconsistent terminology
2. **Propose Changes**: Suggest terminology changes to align with the glossary
3. **Review with Stakeholders**: Confirm that the proposed changes maintain the original intent
4. **Update Documents**: Update all affected documents with consistent terminology
5. **Communicate Changes**: Ensure all team members are aware of the terminology changes

## Training and Awareness

To promote terminology alignment:

1. **Include in Onboarding**: Make terminology alignment part of team onboarding
2. **Regular Reminders**: Periodically review terminology best practices
3. **Terminology Champions**: Designate team members to champion terminology consistency
4. **Celebrate Good Examples**: Recognize team members who consistently use the ubiquitous language

## Conclusion

Consistent terminology alignment between requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, and code is essential for effective domain-driven design. By following the guidelines in this document, teams can ensure that the ubiquitous language is maintained throughout the software development lifecycle, leading to clearer communication, better requirements, and a more maintainable codebase.
