### Phase 3: Complex Integration

Contexts with 3+ upstream dependencies

## Resource Planning

### Team Composition Recommendations

- **Senior Backend Developer** (DDD/Event Sourcing experience)
- **Domain Expert** (Food import/supply chain knowledge)
- **Integration Specialist** (API/EDI integration experience)
- **QA Engineer** (Domain testing and compliance validation)

### Parallel Development Strategy

- **Stream 1**: Focus on core business contexts (batch_tracking, cold_chain, inventory)
- **Stream 2**: Focus on supporting contexts (notifications, reviews, shopping_cart)
- **Integration Points**: Coordinate between streams for context boundaries

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All contexts pass integration tests with existing system
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet SLA requirements
- [ ] Domain experts validate business logic accuracy
- [ ] Regulatory compliance requirements are satisfied
- [ ] Documentation is complete and maintainable
