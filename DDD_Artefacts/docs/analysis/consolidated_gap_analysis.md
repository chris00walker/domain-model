# Domain Model Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive gap analysis of the domain model, combining both business and technical perspectives. It identifies gaps by comparing the implementation against a standard eCommerce reference model, analysis of perishable goods requirements, and technical analysis of the current implementation.

## Analysis Methodology

1. **Reference Model Comparison**: Comparing the implementation against a standard eCommerce reference model
2. **Perishable Goods Analysis**: Reviewing requirements specific to perishable food and beverage e-commerce
3. **DDD Pattern Analysis**: Evaluating implementation against DDD best practices for complex domains
4. **Scenario Stress-Testing**: Walking through common user journeys to identify unsupported steps
5. **Source Code Inspection**: Direct examination of the implementation in `/DDD_Artefacts/src`
6. **Documentation Review**: Analysis of documentation in `/DDD_Artefacts/docs/v2`
7. **Context Mapping Analysis**: Identifying missing integrations between bounded contexts

## Gap Assessment Framework

Each gap is evaluated using the following criteria:
