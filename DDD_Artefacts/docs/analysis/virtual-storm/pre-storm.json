  "notes": [
    "The 'ImportProduct' command is responsible for initiating the import of a new product into the system, which, upon successful completion, triggers the 'ProductImported' event to notify other components of the system that a new product is now available for processing and sales.",
    "This event captures scenarios where the product import process fails due to various reasons such as validation errors or connection issues. The corresponding command allows users to attempt the import again, ensuring that the system can handle errors gracefully and maintain data integrity.",
    "The ProductImportCompleted event signifies that a product has been successfully imported and is now available in the system. The CompleteProductImport command could be used to finalize the import process, ensuring that all necessary post-import actions (like inventory updates and notifications) are executed.",
    "The event 'ProductImportCancelled' represents a situation where an ongoing product import process has been halted by the user or system due to various reasons such as errors, incorrect data, or business decisions. The corresponding command 'CancelProductImport' allows the user to initiate this cancellation process. This helps in maintaining better control over the import workflow and ensures that resources are not wasted on imports that are no longer needed.",
    "This event indicates that a product import process has started but is not yet completed. The corresponding command allows the application to initiate the import, providing visibility into the import status and helping manage the workflow.",
    "This event indicates that the product import process has failed validation checks, which are crucial for ensuring data integrity and compliance with security policies. The corresponding command allows users to trigger the validation process for a product before attempting an import, aligning with the principles of zero trust by ensuring only valid data is processed.",
    "This event signifies that a product has successfully passed all validation checks during the import process, allowing the import to proceed. The corresponding command triggers the validation process, reflecting the need for clear steps in managing the product import lifecycle.",
    "This event signifies that a critical error has been identified during the product import process, which requires immediate attention. The corresponding command allows users to formally report the error, ensuring that it is logged and addressed, improving the overall reliability and accountability of the import process.",
    "Integrating with UserManagement would allow for centralized user authentication and authorization, ensuring consistent access control across systems.",
    "The Authentication bounded context is essential for verifying user identities and managing secure access to the system. Integrating UserManagement with Authentication ensures that user data is accurately synchronized and that authentication tokens can be issued based on user profiles.",
    "Integrating PaymentProcessing with UserManagement and Authentication will ensure secure payment transactions linked to user accounts and enhance overall security by verifying user identities during payment processing.",
    "Integrating OrderManagement with UserManagement and PaymentProcessing will streamline the order lifecycle, ensuring that user data is accurately reflected in order histories and that payments are securely processed in real-time."
