## Domain Overview

The [[Inventory]] Management domain is responsible for tracking, controlling, and optimizing the stock of specialty food products throughout Elias Food Imports' supply chain. This domain handles [[Inventory]] levels, warehouse management, batch tracking, expiration date monitoring, and [[Inventory]] forecasting. It serves as a critical component that ensures [[Product]] availability while minimizing waste, particularly important for specialty food items that often have limited shelf life, special storage requirements, and varying seasonal availability.

The current implementation of the [[Inventory]] Management domain has been identified as having significant gaps, particularly in batch/expiration tracking, temperature-controlled storage management, and forecasting capabilities for perishable items. This document outlines the comprehensive domain model for [[Inventory]] Management with a focus on addressing these gaps to better support Elias Food Imports' specialty food business.

## Strategic Importance

**Classification**: Core Domain

**Justification**: The [[Inventory]] Management domain is classified as a core domain for Elias Food Imports because effective [[Inventory]] management of specialty food products represents a significant competitive advantage in the market. The ability to maintain optimal [[Inventory]] levels of premium, often perishable products while ensuring quality, freshness, and authenticity directly impacts [[Customer]] satisfaction, operational efficiency, and profitability. The specialized requirements of food [[Inventory]] management—including batch tracking, expiration monitoring, temperature control, and regulatory compliance—make this domain a key differentiator for Elias Food Imports rather than a commodity function.

## Core Concepts

### [[Inventory]] Item

The basic unit of [[Inventory]] tracking, representing a specific [[Product]] at a specific location with attributes including quantity, status, and storage conditions.

### [[Inventory]] Batch

A group of [[Inventory]] items that share common characteristics such as production date, expiration date, supplier, and quality attributes, allowing for precise tracking and management of [[Product]] lifecycle.

### Storage Location

A physical or logical location where [[Inventory]] is stored, including attributes such as temperature range, humidity level, and storage capacity, critical for maintaining food quality.

### [[Inventory]] Reservation

A temporary allocation of [[Inventory]] that prevents it from being assigned to other orders or processes, ensuring availability during [[Customer]] checkout or other operations.

### [[Inventory]] Movement

A record of [[Inventory]] changing location, status, or ownership within the system, providing a complete audit trail of [[Product]] flow.

### Expiration Tracking

The monitoring and management of [[Product]] expiration dates to ensure food safety, minimize waste, and optimize [[Inventory]] rotation.

### Temperature Control

The monitoring and management of storage temperatures for products requiring specific temperature ranges to maintain quality and safety.

### [[Inventory]] Forecast

Predictions of future [[Inventory]] levels based on historical data, seasonality, promotions, and other factors to optimize purchasing and production planning.

### Quality Control

The processes and checks that ensure [[Inventory]] meets quality standards, including sensory evaluation, laboratory testing, and compliance verification.

### [[Inventory]] Allocation

The assignment of specific [[Inventory]] to fulfill [[Customer]] orders or other business needs, often following FIFO (First In, First Out) or FEFO (First Expired, First Out) principles.

## Business Rules

### [[Inventory]] Tracking and Management

1. All [[Inventory]] items must be associated with a specific storage location and [[Product]] SKU.
2. [[Inventory]] levels must be updated in real-time when products are received, allocated, shipped, or adjusted.
3. Negative [[Inventory]] is not permitted; [[Inventory]] operations that would result in negative quantities must be rejected.
4. Each [[Inventory]] transaction must be recorded with timestamp, user, quantity, reason code, and reference information.
5. [[Inventory]] counts must be reconciled with physical counts at least weekly for high-value items and monthly for standard items.
6. [[Inventory]] accuracy must be maintained at ≥ 99.9% as measured by physical [[Inventory]] counts.
7. [[Inventory]] adjustments exceeding $500 in value require manager approval and documentation.
8. Real-time [[Inventory]] visibility must be provided to all relevant stakeholders, including sales, purchasing, and fulfillment teams.

### Batch and Expiration Management

1. All perishable products must be tracked at the batch level with production and expiration dates.
2. [[Inventory]] allocation must follow FEFO (First Expired, First Out) principles for perishable items.
3. System must generate alerts for products approaching expiration: 30 days, 14 days, and 7 days before expiration.
4. Products that have reached 75% of their shelf life must be flagged for potential promotional [[Pricing]].
5. Expired products must be automatically quarantined and not available for sale.
6. Batch information must include supplier, country of origin, production date, and any applicable certification information.
7. Complete batch traceability must be maintained from supplier to [[Customer]] for food safety and recall management.
8. Batch sampling protocols must be defined and executed for quality assurance purposes.

### Temperature-Controlled [[Inventory]]

1. Products must be stored in locations with appropriate temperature ranges as defined in their [[Product]] specifications.
2. Temperature-controlled storage locations must be continuously monitored with alerts for out-of-range conditions.
3. Temperature excursions must be logged with duration and magnitude to assess [[Product]] quality impact.
4. Cold chain compliance must be maintained and documented throughout the receiving, storage, and shipping processes.
5. Products exposed to temperature excursions must be evaluated by quality control before being made available for sale.
6. Temperature logs must be maintained for regulatory compliance and quality assurance for a minimum of 3 years.
7. Different temperature zones (ambient, refrigerated, frozen) must be clearly defined with appropriate [[Inventory]] segregation.
8. Temperature-sensitive products must be labeled with appropriate handling instructions.

### [[Inventory]] Reservations

1. [[Inventory]] reservations are created when items are added to a shopping cart with a default duration of 30 minutes.
2. Reservations are automatically extended during active cart sessions.
3. Expired reservations are automatically released back to available [[Inventory]].
4. Reservations are converted to allocations when an [[Order]] is placed.
5. Reservation conflicts must be resolved with priority given to completed orders over cart reservations.
6. Reservation status must be visible to [[Customer]] service and sales teams.
7. Bulk reservations for B2B customers may have extended durations based on [[Customer]] agreements.
8. Reservation capacity must not exceed 25% of available [[Inventory]] for any SKU to prevent artificial stockouts.

### [[Inventory]] Forecasting and Planning

1. [[Inventory]] forecasts must be generated weekly for a 12-week forward horizon.
2. Forecast accuracy must be measured and maintained at ≥ 85% for A-category items.
3. Seasonal patterns must be incorporated into forecast algorithms for specialty food items.
4. Safety stock levels must be dynamically calculated based on demand variability, lead time, and service level targets.
5. Reorder points must trigger purchase recommendations automatically.
6. Slow-moving [[Inventory]] (no movement in 60 days) must be flagged for review.
7. Forecast models must incorporate promotional events, seasonality, and historical sales patterns.
8. [[Inventory]] optimization must balance service levels (target ≥ 98%) with [[Inventory]] carrying costs.

### Quality Control and Compliance

1. All received [[Inventory]] must pass quality inspection before being made available for sale.
2. Quality control samples must be taken from each batch according to the sampling plan.
3. Products failing quality checks must be quarantined pending supplier resolution.
4. All quality control results must be recorded and linked to the specific [[Inventory]] batch.
5. Regulatory compliance documentation must be maintained for each [[Product]] batch.
6. Allergen control protocols must be followed for storage location assignments to prevent cross-contamination.
7. Recall procedures must enable identification and quarantine of affected batches within 2 hours of notification.
8. Quality metrics must be tracked and reported monthly, including rejection rates and quality incidents.
