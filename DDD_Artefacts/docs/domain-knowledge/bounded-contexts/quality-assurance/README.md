The [[Catalog]] context is responsible for verifying the authenticity and provenance of specialty food products in the Elias Food Imports [[Catalog]]. This bounded context handles the end-to-end [[Authentication]] process, from scanning [[Product]] [[Authentication]] markers to maintaining provenance records and handling counterfeit detection.

## 2. Strategic Importance

This bounded context represents a **core domain** for Elias Food Imports as it directly addresses the primary business differentiator: guaranteed authenticity of specialty imported food products. The [[Authentication]] system builds [[Customer]] trust and protects brand reputation by ensuring products are genuine imports from their claimed origin.

## 3. Core Concepts

The [[Catalog]] [[Authentication]] context defines several key concepts that are fundamental to its operation:

### [[Authentication]] Scan
A process where a [[Product]]'s [[Authentication]] markers are verified through physical, digital, or blockchain means.

### Provenance Record
Complete history of a [[Product]] from originating producer through the supply chain to Elias Food Imports.

### [[Authentication]] Marker
Physical or digital element on [[Product]] packaging that can be validated (QR code, hologram, NFC tag).

### Verification Status
The current [[Authentication]] state of a [[Product]] (Verified, Failed, Pending, Quarantined).

### Counterfeit Detection
Processes and algorithms for identifying potentially counterfeit products.

## 4. Business Rules

1. All imported products must have at least one verifiable [[Authentication]] marker
2. [[Authentication]] scans must be logged with timestamp, location, and operator information
3. Failed [[Authentication]] requires immediate quarantine status and investigation
4. Verified products must maintain a complete, immutable provenance record
5. [[Authentication]] success rate must remain above 99.5% for operational excellence
6. Counterfeit detection must achieve 98% or higher detection rate
7. Products in "Quarantine" status cannot be made available for sale

## 5. Domain Events

Domain events represent significant occurrences within the [[Authentication]] context that other parts of the system may need to react to.

| Event | Description | Consumers |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| `ProductAuthenticated` | [[Product]] has passed [[Authentication]] checks | [[Catalog]], [[Inventory]] |
| `AuthenticationFailed` | [[Product]] failed [[Authentication]] verification | [[Inventory]], Notification |
| `ProductQuarantined` | [[Product]] placed in quarantine pending investigation | [[Inventory]], Reporting |
| `ProvenanceVerified` | Completed verification of [[Product]]'s full supply chain | [[Catalog]], Marketing |
| `CounterfeitDetected` | System has identified a potential counterfeit [[Product]] | Notification, Reporting |

## 6. Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects

### Aggregates
- **AuthenticationRecord**: Root entity managing the verification process and results

### Entities
- **ProvenanceRecord**: Entity tracking supply chain history
- **AuthenticationMarker**: Entity representing verification markers on products
- **QuarantineCase**: Entity for products requiring investigation

### Value Objects
- **VerificationStatusVO**: Typed enumeration of [[Authentication]] statuses
- **AuthenticationScore**: Numeric representation of verification confidence
- **MarkerType**: Types of supported [[Authentication]] technologies
- **QuarantineReasonVO**: Reason for [[Product]] quarantine

## 7. Domain Services

Key domain services that encapsulate business logic and coordinate between entities:

- **AuthenticationService**: Core service for verifying [[Product]] authenticity
  ```typescript
  interface AuthenticationService {
    authenticateProduct(markerId: string): Promise<AuthenticationResult>;
    verifyProvenance(provenanceId: string): Promise<ProvenanceVerification>;
  }
  ```

- **ProvenanceService**: Service for tracing [[Product]] origins and handling
- **CounterfeitDetectionService**: Specialized service for identifying suspect products
  ```typescript
  interface CounterfeitDetectionService {
    analyzeProduct(productId: string): Promise<CounterfeitAnalysis>;
    reportCounterfeit(caseDetails: CounterfeitCase): Promise<void>;
  }
  ```
