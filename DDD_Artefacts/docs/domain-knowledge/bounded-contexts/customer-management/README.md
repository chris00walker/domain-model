   - Core [[Customer]] Service: [[Customer]] CRUD operations
   - Segmentation Service: Segment analysis and assignment
   - Loyalty Service: Points and rewards management
   - [[Customer]] Insights Service: Analytics and recommendations

4. **Data Storage Strategy**:
   - Primary [[Customer]] data: Document database (MongoDB/CosmosDB)
   - [[Customer]] search: Elasticsearch for complex querying
   - [[Customer]] analytics: Data warehouse with dimensional model
   - Historical events: Append-only event store

### Technical Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Cache frequently accessed [[Customer]] profiles
   - Implement segmentation calculation as background process
   - Consider read replicas for high-traffic [[Customer]] lookup operations
   - Segment bulk operations for large [[Customer]] data updates

2. **Security Requirements**:
   - Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data
   - Role-based access control for [[Customer]] data
   - Audit logging for all [[Customer]] data access
   - Compliance with data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
   - Data retention policies and purging mechanisms

3. **Integration Patterns**:
   - Domain Event Publication: Kafka/RabbitMQ for event distribution
   - Synchronous APIs: REST/GraphQL for direct queries
   - [[Customer]] Data Sync: CDC (Change Data Capture) for real-time updates
   - Segment Webhooks: Push notifications for segment changes

4. **Resilience Patterns**:
   - Circuit breakers for integration points
   - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Fallback strategies for dependency failures
   - Graceful degradation of non-critical features

### Priority Implementations

1. **Phase 1 (Immediate)**:
   - Core [[Customer]] domain model implementation
   - Basic segmentation capabilities
   - Essential domain events
   - Critical integration points ([[Order]], [[Subscription]]
   
2. **Phase 2 (3-6 months)**:
   - Advanced segmentation algorithms
   - Loyalty program implementation
   - [[Customer]] insight generation
   - Extended integration points
   - [[Customer]] Segment Extensions (segmentType enum, segment-specific VOs)

3. **Phase 3 (6-12 months)**:
   - Predictive analytics integration
   - [[Customer]] journey mapping
   - Machine learning recommendation engine
   - [[Customer]] Segment Webhooks for external system integration
   - 360-degree [[Customer]] view

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Domain model validation rules
   - Segmentation calculation logic
   - Loyalty point calculations
   - Value object immutability

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Event publication and consumption
   - API contract validation
   - Database persistence operations
   - Cache interaction

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Large [[Customer]] base segmentation performance
   - [[Customer]] lookup response times
   - Concurrent update handling
   - Event processing throughput

4. **Business Acceptance Testing**:
   - Segmentation accuracy ≥ 90%
   - Churn prediction accuracy ≥ 85%
   - [[Customer]] lifetime value calculation accuracy
   - Loyalty program ROI ≥ 3:1
   - Overall churn reduction ≥ 30%

### Monitoring and Observability

1. **Key Metrics**:
   - [[Customer]] data read/write latency
   - Segmentation process duration
   - [[Customer]] record access patterns
   - Domain event processing times
   - API response times by endpoint

2. **Alerting Thresholds**:
   - [[Customer]] service error rate > 0.1%
   - [[Customer]] data synchronization delay > 5 minutes
   - Segmentation process duration > 30 minutes
   - [[Customer]] lookup latency > 200ms (p95)

3. **Dashboards**:
   - Operational health dashboard
   - [[Customer]] data quality metrics
   - Segmentation effectiveness visualization
   - Integration health status
