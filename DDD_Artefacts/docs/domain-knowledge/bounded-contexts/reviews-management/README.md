## Domain Overview

The Review Domain manages the collection, processing, and utilization of [[Customer]] feedback about products in the Elias Food Imports (EFI) system. It encompasses all aspects of [[Product]] reviews, ratings, and feedback mechanisms that help ensure [[Product]] quality and improve [[Customer]] satisfaction.

## Strategic Importance

The Review Domain is strategically important to Elias Food Imports for the following reasons:

1. **[[Product]] Quality Assurance**: [[Customer]] reviews provide real-world insights into [[Product]] quality, helping identify issues requiring attention
2. **[[Customer]] Trust Building**: Transparent review systems build trust with customers by showing commitment to quality and [[Customer]] satisfaction
3. **Social Proof**: Positive reviews serve as social proof for potential customers, driving new sales and [[Customer]] acquisition
4. **Data-Driven [[Product]] Development**: Review data informs [[Product]] improvements and new [[Product]] development
5. **Marketing Content Generation**: Authentic reviews provide valuable content for marketing campaigns
6. **Counterfeit Detection**: Review patterns can help identify potentially counterfeit products in the market

## Core Concepts

### 1. Review

A formal assessment of a [[Product]] provided by a [[Customer]] after purchase or consumption, including both quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback.

### 2. Rating

A numerical score (typically on a 1-5 scale) that quantifies a [[Customer]]'s satisfaction with a [[Product]].

### 3. Review Moderation

The process of evaluating user-submitted reviews to ensure they meet content guidelines before they are published.

### 4. Sentiment Analysis

The systematic identification, extraction, and categorization of opinions expressed in review text to determine whether the reviewer's attitude is positive, negative, or neutral.

### 5. Verified Purchase

A designation indicating that a review was submitted by a [[Customer]] who purchased the [[Product]] through official EFI channels, enhancing the credibility of the review.

### 6. Review Response

An official reply from EFI or [[Product]] suppliers to [[Customer]] reviews, addressing concerns or acknowledging feedback.

### 7. Review Aggregation

The process of combining multiple reviews to generate summary statistics and insights about [[Product]] performance.

## Business Rules

### Review Submission

1. Only registered customers who have purchased a [[Product]] may submit reviews for that [[Product]]
2. Customers may only submit one review per [[Product]], but may edit their review within 30 days of submission
3. Reviews must include both a rating (1-5 scale) and a text comment of at least 20 characters
4. Reviews cannot be submitted until at least 7 days after [[Product]] delivery to ensure adequate usage experience
5. Customers cannot review products they themselves supply (in the case of marketplace sellers)

### Review Content

1. Review content must not contain profanity, personal attacks, or promotional material
2. Review content must not contain personally identifiable information or contact details
3. Reviews discussing [[Product]] authenticity must be flagged for investigation by the [[Catalog]] [[Authentication]] Context
4. Images attached to reviews must be directly related to the [[Product]] being reviewed
5. All review content must comply with EFI's content guidelines and terms of service

### Review Moderation

1. All reviews must pass through moderation before being publicly displayed
2. Reviews must be moderated within 48 hours of submission
3. Rejected reviews must include a rejection reason that is communicated to the [[Customer]]
4. Reviews containing critical [[Product]] quality or safety concerns must be escalated to Quality Assurance within 24 hours
5. Moderation decisions can be appealed by customers once per review

### Review Display

1. Reviews are displayed in [[Order]] of helpfulness ranking, with verified purchase reviews given priority
2. Review summary statistics must be updated within 1 hour of a new review being approved
3. Products with fewer than 5 reviews should display an "Early Reviews" indicator
4. Reviews older than 12 months must be clearly labeled as such
5. Reviews for previous versions of a [[Product]] must be clearly distinguished from current version reviews

### Review Analysis

1. All reviews must be analyzed for sentiment and key topics within 24 hours of approval
2. Products receiving three consecutive 1-star reviews must trigger a quality alert
3. Significant deviations in average rating (>1 point within a 30-day period) must trigger an investigation
4. Review patterns indicating potential misuse must be flagged for fraud investigation

   - Moderation Service: Manages review approval workflow
   - Analytics Service: Processes review content for insights
   - Aggregation Service: Maintains [[Product]]-level review statistics

4. **Data Storage Strategy**:
   - Review Content: Document database (MongoDB/CosmosDB)
   - Review Events: Event store for complete history
   - Review Search: Elasticsearch for text search and analytics
   - Review Metrics: Time-series database for trend analysis

### Technical Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Cache aggregate review statistics for high-traffic [[Product]] pages
   - Implement background processing for content analysis and sentiment extraction
   - Use materialized views for commonly accessed review lists and statistics
   - Optimize review search with proper indices and relevance algorithms

2. **Security Requirements**:
   - Implement rate limiting for review submission to prevent abuse
   - Apply strong [[Authentication]] for review submission and helpfulness voting
   - Encrypt moderator notes and internal discussion
   - Maintain complete audit trail of moderation decisions
   - Filter personally identifiable information from review exports

3. **Integration Patterns**:
   - Publish-Subscribe: Domain events for cross-context communication
   - Request-Response: APIs for direct review data access
   - Data Pipeline: For analytical processing of review content
   - Webhooks: For real-time notifications of quality issues

4. **Resilience Patterns**:
   - Implement retry logic for external service dependencies
   - Design for graceful degradation of review features
   - Maintain review submission capability during downstream service outages
   - Implement circuit breakers for integration points
