## 1. Domain Overview

The Marketing Domain manages all aspects of promotional activities, campaign management, content strategy, and [[Customer]] engagement initiatives for Elias Food Imports. This domain is responsible for creating, executing, and measuring marketing campaigns to drive [[Customer]] acquisition, retention, and brand awareness.

## 2. Strategic Importance

**Domain Classification**: Supporting

The Marketing Domain is a supporting domain that enhances the value of core domains by increasing [[Customer]] engagement, acquisition, and retention. While not directly tied to the core [[Product]] offerings, effective marketing is critical for business growth and [[Customer]] engagement.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Campaign
A coordinated series of marketing activities designed to achieve specific business objectives, such as [[Product]] launches, seasonal promotions, or [[Customer]] acquisition initiatives. Campaigns have defined start and end dates, target audiences, budgets, and success metrics.

### Content
Marketing materials including [[Product]] descriptions, cultural and regional information, recipes, pairing recommendations, and promotional offers that enhance [[Product]] value and [[Customer]] engagement. Content may be translated and localized for specific regional markets.

### Segment
A defined group of customers sharing common characteristics such as purchase behavior, demographics, or engagement patterns. Segments are used to target specific marketing campaigns and personalize [[Customer]] interactions.

### Channel
Communication medium used to deliver marketing messages to customers, including email, social media, website, mobile app notifications, SMS, and print materials. Each channel has specific requirements and best practices.

### Engagement Metrics
Quantitative measures of [[Customer]] interactions with marketing content, including open rates, click-through rates, conversion rates, and social media engagement. These metrics inform campaign effectiveness and future marketing strategies.

### A/B Test
Controlled experiment comparing two or more variations of marketing content or strategy to determine which performs better against defined metrics. A/B tests guide optimization of marketing efforts through data-driven decision-making.

## 4. Business Rules

### Campaign Rules
1. All campaigns must have a defined target audience, budget, timeline, and success metrics before launch.
2. Campaign performance must be reviewed at pre-defined milestones and adjusted as necessary based on performance data.
3. Campaigns targeting specific cultural or regional segments must undergo cultural appropriateness review by regional experts.
4. Campaign ROI must be measured and must exceed the company benchmark of 3:1 to be considered successful.
5. All campaign assets must adhere to Elias Food Imports brand guidelines and receive approval before public release.

### Content Rules
1. All [[Product]]-related content must be factually accurate and verified against the [[Product]] [[Catalog]].
2. Cultural and regional content must be authored or reviewed by subject matter experts from the specific region.
3. Content must be localized for target markets, not merely translated.
4. Content creation must follow the established editorial calendar and prioritization framework.
5. All content must include appropriate metadata to facilitate proper indexing and searchability.

### [[Customer]] Segmentation Rules
1. [[Customer]] segments must be reviewed and updated quarterly based on the latest transaction and engagement data.
2. Segmentation must consider both behavioral data (purchase history, engagement) and profile data (region, preferences).
3. All marketing activities must target at least one defined [[Customer]] segment.
4. High-value [[Customer]] segments must receive personalized marketing communications.
5. Experimental segments require A/B testing validation before full-scale implementation.

### Compliance Rules
1. All marketing materials must comply with regional food marketing regulations in target markets.
2. [[Customer]] data used for segmentation and targeting must comply with applicable privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
3. Promotional [[Pricing]] and discounts must align with the [[Pricing]] domain's policies and rules.
4. Marketing claims about [[Product]] authenticity must be verifiable through the [[Catalog]] [[Authentication]] domain.
5. Opt-out requests must be processed within 24 hours of receipt.

## 10. Integration Points

The Marketing domain integrates with several other bounded contexts to ensure cohesive business operations.

### [[Customer]] Context

**Integration Type**: Bidirectional

- Marketing sends opt-in/opt-out preferences to [[Customer]] context

**Integration Mechanism**: Domain events, shared API

### [[Catalog]] Context

**Integration Type**: Consumer

**Purpose**: Access [[Product]] information for marketing content creation.

**Key Touchpoints**:
- Marketing accesses [[Product]] details and imagery for content creation
- [[Catalog]] notifies Marketing of new or updated products requiring content

**Integration Mechanism**: Domain events, read-only API

**Integration Type**: Consumer

**Purpose**: Receive [[Order]] data for campaign performance analysis and post-purchase marketing.

**Key Touchpoints**:
- [[Order]] context notifies Marketing of completed purchases
- Marketing uses [[Order]] data for attribution and ROI calculations

**Integration Mechanism**: Domain events

### [[Subscription]] Context

**Integration Type**: Bidirectional

- Notification context provides delivery status and engagement metrics

**Integration Mechanism**: Command API, callback events

## 11. Implementation Recommendations

### Architecture

1. **CQRS Pattern Implementation**: The Marketing domain should implement Command Query Responsibility Segregation to optimize for both high-volume read operations (content retrieval, segment queries) and transactional write operations (campaign management).

2. **Hexagonal Architecture**: Implement using a ports and adapters (hexagonal) approach to isolate domain logic from external systems and integration mechanisms.

3. **Event-Driven Communication**: Utilize an event-driven approach for integration with other bounded contexts, publishing domain events for key state changes and subscribing to relevant events from other domains.

4. **Data Partitioning**: Consider content and campaign data partitioning strategies to handle large volumes of marketing assets across diverse [[Product]] categories and regions.

### Technical Considerations

1. **Segment Processing Engine**: Build a specialized processing engine for [[Customer]] segment calculation that can efficiently evaluate segment criteria against large [[Customer]] datasets.

2. **Content Repository**: Implement a dedicated content repository with versioning support, search capabilities, and media asset management.

3. **Performance Metrics Dashboard**: Create a real-time analytics dashboard for campaign and segment performance monitoring.

4. **A/B Testing Framework**: Build infrastructure to support A/B testing of marketing content and campaigns with statistical analysis capabilities.

### Priority Implementations

Based on the company's strategic priorities, implement the following components in [[Order]]:

1. **[[Customer]] Segment Webhooks** (Priority 4): Create webhook infrastructure to notify external systems of segment changes and membership updates. This aligns with the CRM/Marketing Foundation priority in the implementation plan.

2. **Segment Type Enhancements**: Extend the segmentation system to support new segmentType enumerations and segment-specific value objects for more sophisticated [[Customer]] targeting.

3. **Content Service Backend**: Implement storage and retrieval systems for cultural content to enrich [[Product]] marketing with authentic regional context.

### Testing Strategy

1. **Segment Calculation Tests**: Verify segment membership rules with comprehensive test cases covering boundary conditions and complex criteria.

2. **Campaign Performance Simulator**: Create a simulation environment to test campaign performance metrics calculation.

3. **Content Approval Workflow Tests**: Ensure content management workflows correctly enforce approval processes and permissions.

4. **Integration Testing**: Focus on testing integrations with [[Customer]] and [[Catalog]] contexts as these are the most critical for Marketing operations.
