## 3. Domain Event Publishing and Subscribing Paths

### Domain Event Mechanism:
The codebase uses a `DomainEvents` class in the shared domain for event handling. This class:
- Allows aggregates to be marked for event dispatch
- Provides methods to register event handlers
- Dispatches events to registered handlers

### Event Publishing Paths:

1. **Aggregate Root Level**:
   - Events are added to an aggregate using the `addDomainEvent` method
   - When an aggregate method that changes state is called, it adds the appropriate event
   - Example: When a subscription is cancelled, the `SubscriptionCancelled` event is added

2. **Domain Services Level**:
   - Some services like `PriceCalculationService` publish events directly
   - Example: `PriceCalculationService` publishes `MarginFloorBreached` events

### Event Subscribing Paths:
While the event publishing mechanism is clear, the event subscription paths are not explicitly visible in the code snippets examined. The `DomainEvents` class has registration methods, but concrete implementations of subscribers were not found in the search results.

## 4. Shared Domain Components

### Base Classes:
- `AggregateRoot<T>` - Base class for all aggregates
- `Entity` - Base class for entities (implied)
- `ValueObject` - Base class for value objects
- `DomainEvent` - Base class for domain events

### Value Objects:
- `Money` - Represents monetary values
- `UniqueEntityID` - Represents unique identifiers

## 5. Missing Bounded Contexts from Acceptance Criteria

The following bounded contexts mentioned in the acceptance criteria document are not present as dedicated directories in the codebase:
- Inventory (though some inventory concepts appear in Catalog context)
- Catalog Authentication
- Marketing
- Payment

## 6. Alignment with Business Problem Acceptance Criteria

This domain model inventory aligns with the business problem acceptance criteria document, which defines success metrics for each bounded context:

1. **Catalog Context**: Supports data completeness (≥98%) and search performance (≤500ms) metrics
2. **Catalog Authentication Context**: Not yet implemented as a dedicated context
3. **Pricing Context**: Implements services and rules to support price calculation accuracy (100%) and margin targets (≥35%)
4. **Subscription Context**: Implements comprehensive subscription lifecycle management to support churn rate (≤5%) and MRR growth (≥10%) metrics
5. **Inventory Context**: Partially implemented within Catalog context
6. **Order Context**: Implements order processing to support accuracy (≥99.9%) and processing time (≤5s) metrics
7. **Customer Context**: Implements detailed customer segmentation to support segmentation accuracy (≥90%) metrics
8. **Marketing Context**: Not yet implemented as a dedicated context
9. **Payment Context**: Not yet implemented as a dedicated context, though payment concepts exist in the Order context

## 7. Next Steps for Domain Model Completion

1. Implement missing bounded contexts (Catalog Authentication, Marketing, Payment)
2. Complete the event subscription mechanisms
3. Implement explicit repositories for all aggregates
4. Enhance domain services to fully support the business metrics defined in the acceptance criteria
5. Develop tests for Admin context invariants (e.g., MFA enforcement for privileged roles)
6. Complete integration between Admin and other contexts (especially for moderation workflows)
