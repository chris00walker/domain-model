# Ubiquitous Language Onboarding Program

## Purpose

This document outlines a structured onboarding program to help new team members quickly understand and correctly use the ubiquitous language of the Elias Food Imports domain. The program combines self-study, guided learning, mentoring, and practical exercises to ensure that new team members can effectively communicate using domain terminology and contribute to the ongoing refinement of the ubiquitous language.

## Program Overview

The onboarding program consists of four phases, designed to progressively build understanding and proficiency in the ubiquitous language:

1. **Foundation Phase** (Days 1-3): Introduction to DDD concepts and the ubiquitous language

#### Practical Exercise:
- Analyze a specific aggregate implementation
- Document how the ubiquitous language is applied in the code
- Identify any inconsistencies between code and documentation

### Day 7: Domain Events and Integration

#### Self-Study Materials:
- Domain event documentation
- Context mapping documentation
- Integration patterns used in the project

#### Guided Learning:
- Session on domain events and cross-context communication (1 hour)
- Explanation of how terminology is maintained across boundaries

#### Practical Exercise:
- Trace the flow of a domain event across bounded contexts
- Document the terminology used at each step
- Identify any translation or consistency issues

## Phase 3: Application Phase (Weeks 2-3)

### Week 2: Guided Application

#### Activities:
- Pair programming with experienced team members
- Participation in refinement sessions with terminology focus
- Shadowing domain modeling workshops

#### Practical Exercises:
- Contribute to small tasks with guidance
- Practice using the ubiquitous language in daily standups
- Document any questions or confusions about terminology

### Week 3: Independent Application

#### Activities:
- Work on assigned tasks independently
- Regular terminology review sessions with mentor
- Participation in code reviews with focus on terminology

#### Practical Exercises:
- Complete a feature implementation using correct terminology
- Document domain concepts encountered during implementation
- Propose improvements to existing terminology if needed

## Phase 4: Contribution Phase (Week 4+)

### Ongoing Activities:

- Active participation in domain modeling sessions
- Contribution to terminology refinement
- Regular use of the [Ubiquitous Language Review Checklist](ubiquitous_language_review_checklist.md)

### Contribution Opportunities:

- Propose new terms for the glossary
- Help refine existing definitions
- Participate in terminology reviews
- Mentor newer team members on terminology usage

## Supporting Resources

### Documentation Resources:
- [Enhanced Glossary](enhanced_glossary.md)
- [Ubiquitous Language Guidelines](ubiquitous_language_guidelines.md)
- [Domain Knowledge Repository](domain_knowledge_index.md)
- [Domain Model Inventory](domain_model_inventory.md)
- [Business Metrics Domain Mapping](business_metrics_domain_mapping.md)

### Human Resources:

## Customizing the Program

This onboarding program should be customized based on:

1. **Role of the New Team Member**:
   - Developers: More focus on code implementation
   - Business Analysts: More focus on requirements and documentation
   - QA Engineers: More focus on acceptance criteria and testing terminology

2. **Prior Domain Knowledge**:
   - Adjust depth of domain concept exploration
   - Focus more on new or unfamiliar concepts

3. **Team Size and Availability**:
   - Adjust the amount of 1:1 mentoring
   - Consider group onboarding sessions for multiple new members

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Overwhelmed by Terminology

**Solution**: 
- Break down learning into smaller bounded contexts
- Create a personal glossary of most-used terms
- Focus on one context at a time

### Challenge: Inconsistent Usage in Existing Code

**Solution**:
- Acknowledge known inconsistencies
- Provide historical context for terminology evolution
- Explain current best practices

### Challenge: Difficulty Applying Terms in Practice

**Solution**:
- Increase pair programming sessions
- Review specific examples of correct usage
- Create templates or snippets for common patterns

## Conclusion

Effective onboarding to the ubiquitous language is essential for maintaining a consistent domain model and clear communication within the team. This structured program provides a framework for quickly bringing new team members up to speed with the domain terminology and ensuring they can effectively contribute to its ongoing evolution.

The program should be regularly reviewed and updated based on feedback from new team members and changes to the domain model.
