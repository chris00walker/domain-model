# EFI Domain Model - Modular Glossary System

Generated: 2025-07-21T12:19:38-03:00

## Overview

This modular glossary system provides comprehensive domain terminology for the Elias Food Imports (EFI) domain model, organized by bounded contexts to maintain clear boundaries and facilitate domain-driven design practices.

## Glossary Structure

### Core Foundation

- **[Core Glossary](./core-glossary.md)** - Shared kernel terms used across all bounded contexts

### Bounded Context Glossaries

1. **[Customer Management](./customer-management-glossary.md)** - Customer identity, profiles, and segmentation

2. **[Order Management](./order-management-glossary.md)** - Order lifecycle and fulfillment coordination

3. **[Subscription Management](./subscription-management-glossary.md)** - Recurring orders and subscription services

4. **[Billing & Invoicing](./billing-invoicing-glossary.md)** - Invoice generation and payment tracking

5. **[Shipping & Fulfillment](./shipping-fulfillment-glossary.md)** - Order fulfillment and delivery logistics

6. **[Inventory Management](./inventory-management-glossary.md)** - Stock levels and warehouse operations

## Glossary Statistics

| Context | Aggregates | Value Objects | Domain Services | Domain Events | Repository Interfaces |
|---------|------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Core** | 0 | 8 | 0 | 4 | 0 |
| **Customer Management** | 3 | 6 | 3 | 6 | 1 |
| **Order Management** | 2 | 6 | 3 | 6 | 2 |
| **Subscription Management** | 2 | 7 | 4 | 8 | 2 |
| **Billing & Invoicing** | 2 | 6 | 4 | 6 | 2 |
| **Shipping & Fulfillment** | 2 | 6 | 4 | 6 | 2 |
| **Inventory Management** | 3 | 6 | 4 | 6 | 3 |
| **TOTAL** | **14** | **45** | **22** | **42** | **12** |

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Bounded Context Isolation

- Each glossary is self-contained within its bounded context

- Cross-context references use well-defined integration patterns

- Anti-corruption layers protect context boundaries

### 2. Shared Kernel Foundation

- Core glossary defines terms used across multiple contexts

- Shared value objects (Money, Address, UniqueEntityID) provide consistency

- Common patterns (Result, Clock, Guard) ensure architectural alignment

### 3. Domain Event Coordination

- Events enable loose coupling between bounded contexts

- Event schemas documented in each context glossary

- Clear producer/consumer relationships defined

### 4. Repository Pattern Consistency

- Standard operations (findById, save) across all repositories

- Specialized queries specific to each context's needs

- Result pattern for explicit error handling

## Integration Patterns Summary

### Cross-Context Event Flow

```text
Customer Management → Order Management → Billing & Invoicing
       ↓                    ↓                    ↓
   Subscription       Shipping &           Analytics
   Management        Fulfillment              ↑
       ↓                    ↓                    ↓
   Inventory         Inventory           All Contexts
   Management        Management
```

### Key Integration Points

- **Customer → Order**: Customer validation and profile information

- **Order → Billing**: Invoice generation from confirmed orders

- **Order → Fulfillment**: Fulfillment authorization and coordination

- **Order → Inventory**: Stock reservation and availability

- **Subscription → Order**: Recurring order generation

- **Fulfillment → Inventory**: Stock allocation and movement

## Business Rules Alignment

### Consistency Rules

1. **Customer Identity**: CustomerId used consistently across all contexts

2. **Order References**: OrderId maintains referential integrity

3. **Money Handling**: All financial amounts use shared Money value object

4. **Event Sourcing**: Domain events provide audit trail and integration

5. **Error Handling**: Result pattern used for explicit error management

### Context-Specific Rules

- **Customer Management**: Email uniqueness, GDPR compliance

- **Order Management**: Order modification windows, minimum order values

- **Subscription Management**: Billing cycles, cancellation policies

- **Billing & Invoicing**: Sequential invoice numbering, tax compliance

- **Shipping & Fulfillment**: Delivery windows, carrier integration

- **Inventory Management**: Stock reservations, FIFO for perishables

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers

1. **New Features**: Consult relevant context glossary for terminology

2. **Cross-Context Integration**: Use defined integration patterns and events

3. **Domain Modeling**: Follow established patterns for aggregates and value objects

4. **Testing**: Use domain events for integration testing scenarios

### For Business Stakeholders

1. **Requirements**: Reference glossaries for consistent terminology

2. **User Stories**: Use domain language from appropriate context

3. **Process Documentation**: Align with domain event flows and business rules

4. **Training**: Use glossaries for domain knowledge transfer

### For Product Managers

1. **Feature Planning**: Understand context boundaries and integration points

2. **Roadmap Alignment**: Consider cross-context dependencies

3. **Metrics Definition**: Use domain events for business intelligence

4. **Stakeholder Communication**: Maintain ubiquitous language consistency

## Maintenance and Evolution

### Version Control

- Each glossary versioned independently

- Breaking changes require impact analysis across contexts

- Backward compatibility maintained for integration points

### Update Process

1. **Code Changes**: Update glossary when domain model changes

2. **Business Rules**: Reflect new business rules in appropriate context

3. **Integration**: Update integration patterns when event schemas change

4. **Review**: Regular review with domain experts and stakeholders

### Quality Assurance

- **Consistency Checks**: Automated validation of cross-references

- **Completeness**: Ensure all domain concepts are documented

- **Accuracy**: Regular validation with implementation code

- **Clarity**: Plain language explanations for business stakeholders
