# Admin Domain Knowledge

## Domain Overview

The Admin bounded context is responsible for all administrative functionality within Elias Food Imports, including management of administrative users, role-based access control, content moderation workflows, system configuration, and comprehensive audit logging for security and compliance. This context provides critical infrastructure for managing and governing the entire application ecosystem.

## Strategic Importance

The Admin domain serves as a **Supporting Domain** that enables operational control and governance across all other bounded contexts. While not directly related to the core business of importing specialty food products, it provides essential capabilities for:

1. **Security and Compliance** - Supporting regulatory requirements through comprehensive audit logging and role-based access control
2. **Content Governance** - Ensuring product descriptions, reviews, and other content meet quality standards and regulatory requirements
3. **System Configuration** - Providing flexibility to adapt system behavior without code changes
4. **Operation Management** - Enabling administrators to manage and monitor system health

## Core Concepts and Ubiquitous Language

### Administrative User Management

- **Admin User**: A specialized user account with elevated permissions to manage system functionality.
- **Role**: A named collection of permissions that can be assigned to admin users.
- **Permission**: An authorization to perform specific actions within the system, formatted as `CONTEXT.RESOURCE.ACTION`.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Additional security verification beyond passwords required for all admin accounts.

### Content Moderation

- **Moderation Task**: A unit of work requiring administrative review and approval/rejection.
- **Moderation Status**: The current state of content in the moderation workflow (PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED, FLAGGED, AUTO_APPROVED).
- **Moderation Queue**: The collection of pending content items awaiting review.
- **Auto-Moderation**: AI-driven content screening that can automatically approve safe content.

### System Configuration

- **System Setting**: A configurable parameter that controls system behavior.
- **Feature Flag**: A toggleable setting that enables or disables specific functionality.
- **Security Setting**: Configuration parameters related to system security.

### Audit Logging

- **Audit Log Entry**: A record of an administrative action, including actor, target, action type, and context.
- **Access Auditing**: Tracking of authentication events and resource access.
- **Modification Auditing**: Tracking of data changes with before/after values.

## Business Rules

1. **Administrative Access**
   - All administrative accounts must have MFA enabled
   - Admin accounts can only be created by existing Super Admin users
   - Admin passwords must meet complexity requirements and expire after configured periods
   - Failed login attempts must be logged and trigger lockouts after threshold violations

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Every admin user must have at least one assigned role
   - System roles (Super Admin, System Admin, Read-Only) cannot be modified
   - Custom roles can be created with granular permissions
   - Permission checks must occur at API boundaries and enforce least-privilege principle

3. **Content Moderation**
   - All user-generated content must pass through moderation before publication
   - Content rejections must include justification notes
   - AI moderation can auto-approve content only with â‰¥95% confidence
   - Flagged content requires review by at least two moderators

4. **System Configuration**
   - Security settings can only be modified by Super Admin users
   - All configuration changes must be logged with previous and new values
   - Feature flags must have documented fallback behavior

5. **Audit Requirements**
   - All administrative actions must be logged with complete context
   - Audit logs must include timestamp, user ID, IP address, and action details
   - Audit logs cannot be modified or deleted, only viewed
   - Audit logs must be retained for a configurable period (default: 1 year)

## Alignment with Ubiquitous Language

This domain model adheres to the Ubiquitous Language Consistency Framework by:

1. Following the established naming conventions for aggregates, entities and value objects
2. Using domain-driven terminology in all interface definitions
3. Maintaining consistency with cross-cutting concepts (e.g., user roles)
4. Documenting all domain terms in this knowledge base for reference

All domain events follow the entity-first, past-tense naming convention established in the Domain Event Naming Analysis.
