# Ubiquitous Language Evolution Process

## Purpose

This document outlines the process for maintaining and evolving the ubiquitous language as our understanding of the Elias Food Imports domain grows. It provides structured guidelines for introducing new terms, refining existing definitions, and ensuring consistent terminology usage across all project artifacts.

## Core Principles

1. **Collaborative Ownership**: The ubiquitous language is jointly owned by business and technical stakeholders.
2. **Continuous Refinement**: The language evolves as domain understanding deepens.
3. **Terminology Consistency**: Terms must be used consistently across all contexts.
4. **Business Alignment**: The language must accurately reflect business concepts and processes.
5. **Clear Documentation**: All changes must be properly documented and communicated.

## Evolution Process

### 1. Identifying Terminology Changes

Terminology changes may be triggered by:

- **New Business Requirements**: Introduction of new features or processes
- **Domain Insights**: Deeper understanding of existing concepts
- **Ambiguity Resolution**: Clarification of ambiguous or overloaded terms
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Input from business or technical teams
- **Implementation Challenges**: Issues encountered during development

#### Identification Channels:

- Domain modeling workshops
- Refinement sessions
- Code reviews
- Business stakeholder interviews
- Implementation feedback

### 2. Proposing Terminology Changes

#### For New Terms:

1. **Complete the Term Proposal Form**:
   - Proposed term
   - Definition
   - Business context
   - Related existing terms
   - Rationale for introduction
   - Bounded context(s) where applicable
   - Example usage

2. **Provide Supporting Documentation**:
   - Business requirements referencing the concept
   - Domain expert validation
   - Proposed code examples

#### For Term Modifications:

1. **Complete the Term Modification Form**:
   - Current term and definition
   - Proposed changes
   - Rationale for modification
   - Impact assessment on existing code and documentation
   - Migration strategy

### 3. Review Process

#### Review Committee:

- Product Owner
- Domain Expert(s)
- Lead Developer
- Technical Writer (if available)
- Architect

#### Review Criteria:

1. **Necessity**: Is the term change truly needed?
2. **Clarity**: Is the definition clear and unambiguous?
3. **Distinctiveness**: Is the term sufficiently distinct from existing terms?
4. **Consistency**: Does it align with existing terminology?
5. **Usability**: Can it be effectively used in code and communication?
6. **Impact**: What is the impact on existing code and documentation?

#### Review Meeting Format:

1. Presenter explains the proposed change (5 minutes)
2. Questions and clarifications (10 minutes)
3. Discussion of implications (10 minutes)
4. Decision (Accept/Reject/Revise)

### 4. Documentation Updates

Upon approval, update the following artifacts:

1. **Enhanced Glossary**: Add or modify the term with its definition
2. **Domain Terminology Alignment**: Update mappings if necessary
3. **Domain Knowledge Repository**: Update relevant domain knowledge documents
4. **Context Maps**: Update if the term affects bounded context relationships
5. **Ubiquitous Language Index**: Update to reflect new documentation

### 5. Implementation

#### Code Refactoring:

1. Create a dedicated branch for terminology changes
2. Update class, method, and variable names
3. Update comments and documentation strings
4. Update test cases and test documentation
5. Create migration scripts if database changes are required

#### Documentation Refactoring:

1. Update technical documentation
2. Update business documentation
3. Update API documentation
4. Update user interface text

### 6. Communication and Training

#### Announcement Channels:

- Team meetings
- Project wiki/documentation portal
- Email notifications
- Slack/Teams channels

#### Training Materials:

1. Update onboarding documentation
2. Create quick reference guides for new/changed terms
3. Provide examples of correct usage

### 7. Verification and Compliance

#### Verification Methods:

1. **Code Reviews**: Check for consistent terminology usage
2. **Documentation Reviews**: Verify updated documentation
3. **Static Analysis**: Use tools to detect non-compliant terminology
4. **Pair Programming**: Reinforce correct terminology usage

#### Compliance Metrics:

1. Percentage of codebase using approved terminology
2. Number of terminology inconsistencies found in reviews
3. Time to full adoption of terminology changes

## Handling Special Cases

### Bounded Context-Specific Terminology

When a term has different meanings across bounded contexts:

1. Clearly document the context-specific definitions
2. Use prefixes or qualifiers to disambiguate when necessary
3. Create translation maps between contexts

### Legacy Terminology

When dealing with legacy systems or external integrations:

1. Create explicit mappings between legacy and current terminology
2. Use adapters or anti-corruption layers to translate between systems
3. Document legacy terms in a separate section of the glossary

### External Stakeholder Communication

When communicating with external stakeholders:

1. Provide terminology reference guides
2. Use consistent terminology in all external communications
3. Include glossary references in formal documentation

## Tools and Templates

### Term Proposal Template

```markdown
# Term Proposal

## Proposed Term: [Term Name]

## Definition:
[Clear, concise definition]

## Business Context:
[Where and how this term is used in the business domain]

## Related Existing Terms:
- [Term 1]: [Relationship]
- [Term 2]: [Relationship]

## Rationale:
[Why this term should be added to the ubiquitous language]

## Applicable Bounded Contexts:
- [Context 1]
- [Context 2]

## Example Usage:
[Code or conversation examples using this term]

## Proposed by: [Name]
## Date: [Date]
```

### Term Modification Template

```markdown
# Term Modification

## Current Term: [Term Name]
## Current Definition:
[Existing definition]

## Proposed Changes:
[New definition or modifications]

## Rationale:
[Why this term should be modified]

## Impact Assessment:
[Which code, documentation, or processes will be affected]

## Migration Strategy:
[How to transition to the new terminology]

## Proposed by: [Name]
## Date: [Date]
```

### Terminology Change Log

Maintain a change log of all terminology changes:

```markdown
# Terminology Change Log

| Date | Term | Type | Description | Rationale | Approved By |
|------|------|------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2025-01-15 | Customer | Modification | Clarified that "Customer" refers to organizations, not individuals | Align with business usage | J. Smith |
| 2025-02-03 | SubscriptionPlan | Addition | Added new term for configurable subscription templates | Support new feature | A. Jones |
```

## Governance and Continuous Improvement

### Governance Structure

1. **Terminology Steward**: Responsible for maintaining the glossary and guiding the evolution process
2. **Domain Experts**: Validate business accuracy of terminology
3. **Technical Leads**: Ensure implementability of terminology
4. **Review Committee**: Approve or reject proposed changes

### Review Schedule

1. **Quarterly Reviews**: Comprehensive review of the entire glossary
2. **Sprint Reviews**: Quick check for new terms or issues
3. **Annual Audit**: Deep review with business stakeholders

### Continuous Improvement

1. **Process Feedback**: Collect feedback on the terminology evolution process
2. **Metrics Tracking**: Monitor terminology consistency and adoption
3. **Tool Improvement**: Enhance tools and templates based on usage
4. **Training Refinement**: Update training materials based on common issues

## Conclusion

The ubiquitous language is a living artifact that must evolve as our understanding of the domain grows. By following this structured process for terminology evolution, we ensure that our language remains accurate, consistent, and valuable for both business and technical stakeholders.

This process should itself be subject to continuous improvement, with regular reviews to ensure it remains effective and efficient.
