# Elias Food Imports - Domain-Driven Design Implementation

This repository contains the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) artifacts for the Elias Food Imports (EFI) e-commerce platform. The implementation follows DDD principles and patterns to model the complex domain of specialty food importation, inventory management, order fulfillment, and subscription services.

## Architecture Overview

- **Architecture Pattern**: Hexagonal Modular Monolith (ADR-007)
- **Communication**: Event-Driven Architecture (ADR-008)
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict DDD patterns
- **Status**: Zero TypeScript compilation errors across all bounded contexts
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **TypeScript** 4.9+
- **Docker** (for local development)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Verify TypeScript compilation
npm run build

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Virtual Event Storming

Run a virtual Event Storming session using the Phase 2 agent:

```bash
# Default session (all contexts, OpenAI agent)
npx tsx DDD_Artefacts/scripts/phase2/cli/virtualStorm.ts --agent openai

# Filter by bounded context
npx tsx DDD_Artefacts/scripts/phase2/cli/virtualStorm.ts --agent openai --context order_management

# Customize turn limits via environment variables
export STORM_MAX_TURNS=10
export STORM_STALE_ROUNDS=1
```

### Agent Tools

The Phase 2 agent registers these SDK tools:

- **proposeEvent**: Suggests a new domain event.
- **proposeIntegration**: Proposes a bounded-context integration point.
- **persistStorm**: Saves the brainstorming context as a JSON file.
- **summarizeStorm**: Generates a Markdown summary report.
- **readFile**: Reads UTF-8 content from a file.
- **writeFile**: Writes UTF-8 content to a file, creating directories as needed.
- **log**: Logs messages during agent execution.

All tools use Zod schemas for input validation. The agent enforces JSON-mode output matching:

```json
{
  "events": ["..."],
  "commands": ["..."],
  "integrationPoints": ["..."],
  "notes": ["..."]
}
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Follow DDD Patterns** - Use established aggregates, value objects, and domain events
2. **Reference ADRs** - Check relevant Architecture Decision Records before making changes
3. **Update Documentation** - Maintain ubiquitous language and PRD alignment
4. **Write Tests** - Follow established testing patterns in `/tests/`
5. **Validate Build** - Ensure zero TypeScript errors before committing

## Current Status

### Completed

- **Domain Model**: All 19 bounded contexts implemented with zero TypeScript errors
- **Documentation**: Complete coverage with 21 glossaries, 16 ADRs, 21 PRDs
- **Strategic Alignment**: Business model canvas and value proposition analysis
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage across core domain logic
- **Architecture**: Hexagonal modular monolith with event-driven communication

### In Progress

- Infrastructure layer implementations (MongoDB, RabbitMQ integrations)
- End-to-end testing scenarios
- Performance optimization and caching strategies

## Quality Metrics

- **TypeScript Compilation**: 0 errors across all contexts
- **Documentation Coverage**: 100% bounded context glossary coverage  
- **Architectural Compliance**: Full ADR adherence
- **Domain Model Integrity**: Pure DDD implementation
- **Test Coverage**: Core domain logic fully tested
