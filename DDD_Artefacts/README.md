# Elias Food Imports - Domain-Driven Design Implementation

This repository contains the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) artifacts for the Elias Food Imports (EFI) e-commerce platform. The implementation follows DDD principles and patterns to model the complex domain of specialty food importation, inventory management, order fulfillment, and subscription services.
