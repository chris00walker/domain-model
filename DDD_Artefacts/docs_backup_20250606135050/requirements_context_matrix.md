# Requirements→Context Matrix

## Purpose

This document maps product requirements from the Product Requirements Document to their corresponding bounded contexts within the Elias Food Imports domain model. This mapping ensures clear traceability between business requirements and technical implementation, facilitating alignment between business and development teams.

## Matrix Structure

Each requirement is mapped to one or more bounded contexts with the following information:
- **Requirement ID/Description**: The unique identifier and brief description of the requirement
- **Bounded Context(s)**: The primary and secondary bounded contexts responsible for implementing the requirement
- **Implementation Status**: Current state of implementation (Existing, Partial, NotStarted)
- **Notes/Dependencies**: Additional information, dependencies, or special considerations

## Conclusion

This Requirements→Context Matrix provides a comprehensive mapping between product requirements and bounded contexts in the Elias Food Imports domain model. It serves as a key reference for understanding how business requirements are implemented across the system and helps identify areas that need further development or refinement.

Key observations:

1. Most requirements (56%) have existing implementations, indicating good progress in the system development.
2. Several requirements (30%) have partial implementations, suggesting ongoing development work.
3. A small number of requirements (14%) have not been started yet, representing future development opportunities.
4. The Order, Customer, and Catalog bounded contexts are involved in the most requirements, highlighting their central role in the system.
5. Several domain events need to be implemented to fully support the requirements, particularly in the Customer, Subscription, and Catalog Authentication contexts.

This matrix should be regularly updated as requirements evolve and implementation progresses to maintain an accurate view of the system's capabilities and development status.
