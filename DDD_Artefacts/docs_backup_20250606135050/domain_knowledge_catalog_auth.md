# Catalog Authentication Domain Knowledge

## Domain Overview
The Catalog Authentication domain is identified as a **core domain** with high strategic priority for Elias Food Imports. It enables product authenticity verification, provenance tracking, and establishes trust in premium products. This domain directly supports EFI's premium positioning strategy and creates a competitive advantage through verifiable authenticity claims.

## Strategic Importance
- Enables premium pricing through verifiable authenticity
- Creates a competitive advantage through provenance tracking
- Builds customer trust in product quality and origin claims
- Reduces counterfeit risk and protects brand reputation
- Supports storytelling and cultural connection to products

## Core Concepts

### Product Authentication
The process of verifying that a product is genuine and meets EFI's quality standards:
- **Physical Authentication**: Tamper-evident packaging, security seals, holograms
- **Digital Authentication**: QR codes, NFC tags linked to blockchain or secure database
- **Certificate of Authenticity**: Digital or physical documentation of product origin

### Provenance Chain
The documented journey of a product from producer to consumer:
- **Origin Verification**: Documentation of the product's source
- **Chain of Custody**: Record of all handlers in the supply chain
- **Production Methods**: Documentation of traditional or artisanal methods
- **Quality Certification**: Third-party verification of quality standards

### Authentication Token
A unique identifier that links a physical product to its digital record:
- **QR Code**: Scannable code on packaging linking to product verification page
- **NFC Tag**: Near-field communication tag embedded in packaging
- **Serial Number**: Unique identifier printed on product or packaging
- **Blockchain Token**: Cryptographic token representing ownership or authenticity

### Verification Status
The result of an authentication check:
- **Verified Authentic**: Product confirmed as genuine EFI product
- **Verification Failed**: Unable to confirm product authenticity
- **Previously Verified**: Product has been authenticated before
- **Counterfeit Suspected**: Product failed verification with suspicious indicators
- **Verification Expired**: Authentication token has exceeded its validity period

### Cultural Heritage Documentation
Information about the cultural significance of products:
- **Origin Story**: Narrative about the product's cultural context
- **Producer Profile**: Information about the artisan or producer
- **Traditional Methods**: Documentation of production techniques
- **Cultural Significance**: Information about the product's role in its culture of origin

## Business Rules

### Authentication Rules
1. **Unique Token Requirement**: Each premium product must have a unique authentication token
2. **Verification Limit**: Each token can be verified a maximum of 5 times
3. **Verification Window**: Authentication tokens expire 1 year after purchase
4. **Failed Verification Protocol**: Three consecutive failed verifications trigger fraud alert
5. **B2B Bulk Verification**: Business customers can verify up to 50 products in a batch
6. **Re-authentication Prohibition**: Once a product is marked as counterfeit, it cannot be re-authenticated

### Provenance Chain Rules
1. **Minimum Chain Requirements**: All premium products must have at least 3 documented chain points
2. **Producer Verification**: All producers must be verified through EFI's partner network
3. **Chain Completeness**: No gaps allowed in the custody chain for premium products
4. **Quality Checkpoint Requirement**: At least one third-party quality verification in each chain
5. **Documentation Standards**: All chain participants must provide standardized documentation
6. **Chain Visibility**: Customers can view simplified provenance chain; partners see complete chain

### Token Generation Rules
1. **Centralized Generation**: All authentication tokens generated by EFI central system
2. **Producer Assignment**: Tokens assigned to producers in batches for application
3. **Token-Product Binding**: Each token must be bound to specific product SKU
4. **Token Activation**: Tokens activated only when product enters EFI inventory
5. **Token Revocation**: Ability to revoke tokens for recalled or compromised products
6. **Secure Distribution**: Token distribution requires multi-factor authentication
