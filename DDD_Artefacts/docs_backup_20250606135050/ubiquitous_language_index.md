# Ubiquitous Language Documentation Index

## Overview

This index document provides a central navigation point for all ubiquitous language documentation in the Elias Food Imports domain model. It organizes the various documents that define, explain, and apply the ubiquitous language across the project.

## Core Ubiquitous Language Documents

| Document | Purpose | Key Contents |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| [Enhanced Glossary](enhanced_glossary.md) | Comprehensive reference for domain terminology | Core domain terms, bounded contexts, aggregates, domain events, value objects, domain services, repositories, policies |
| [Ubiquitous Language Guidelines](ubiquitous_language_guidelines.md) | Guidelines for consistent terminology usage | Naming conventions, code examples, documentation standards, maintenance processes |
| [Domain Terminology Alignment](domain_terminology_alignment.md) | Maps terms between requirements and implementation | Terminology gaps, inconsistencies, harmonization recommendations |
| [Domain Terms in Requirements](domain_terms_in_requirements.md) | Maps glossary terms to product requirements | Term usage context, consistency analysis, alignment recommendations |
| [Business Metrics Domain Mapping](business_metrics_domain_mapping.md) | Maps business metrics to domain model | Implementation status, recommendations, integration examples |

## Domain Knowledge Repository

The following documents provide detailed domain knowledge for specific bounded contexts:

| Document | Bounded Context | Key Concepts |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| [Domain Knowledge Index](domain_knowledge_index.md) | All | Central entry point to domain knowledge |
| [Pricing Domain Knowledge](domain_knowledge/pricing_domain_knowledge.md) | Pricing | Pricing rules, margin protection, promotional pricing |
| [Subscription Domain Knowledge](domain_knowledge/subscription_domain_knowledge.md) | Subscription | Subscription lifecycle, bundles, billing |
| [Catalog Authentication Domain Knowledge](domain_knowledge/catalog_authentication_domain_knowledge.md) | Catalog Authentication | Product authenticity, QR provenance, supply chain |
| [Customer Domain Knowledge](domain_knowledge/customer_domain_knowledge.md) | Customer | Customer segments, lifecycle, preferences |

## Domain Model Analysis

These documents analyze the current state of the domain model:

| Document | Purpose | Key Contents |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| [Domain Model Inventory](domain_model_inventory.md) | Catalogs current domain model components | Bounded contexts, aggregates, entities, domain events |
| [Domain Model Gap Analysis](domain_model_gap_analysis.md) | Identifies gaps in domain model | Missing components, implementation priorities |

## Related Business Documentation

These documents define the business requirements and acceptance criteria:

| Document | Purpose | Key Contents |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| [Product Requirements Document](02_product_requirements_document.md) | Defines product functionality | Features, requirements, bounded contexts |
| [Business Problem Acceptance Criteria](business_problem_acceptance_criteria.md) | Defines success criteria | Measurable metrics, acceptance criteria |

## Using This Documentation

### For Business Stakeholders

1. Start with the [Enhanced Glossary](enhanced_glossary.md) to understand the terminology
2. Review [Business Problem Acceptance Criteria](business_problem_acceptance_criteria.md) to understand success metrics
3. Explore [Domain Knowledge Index](domain_knowledge_index.md) to dive deeper into specific areas
4. Reference [Domain Terms in Requirements](domain_terms_in_requirements.md) to see how terminology is used in requirements

### For Developers

1. Start with the [Enhanced Glossary](enhanced_glossary.md) to understand the terminology
2. Follow the [Ubiquitous Language Guidelines](ubiquitous_language_guidelines.md) when writing code
3. Use [Domain Model Inventory](domain_model_inventory.md) to understand the current implementation
4. Reference [Domain Terminology Alignment](domain_terminology_alignment.md) to ensure consistency
5. Consult [Business Metrics Domain Mapping](business_metrics_domain_mapping.md) when implementing metrics

### For New Team Members

1. Start with this index document to understand the documentation structure
2. Review the [Enhanced Glossary](enhanced_glossary.md) to learn the ubiquitous language
3. Study the [Domain Knowledge Index](domain_knowledge_index.md) to understand the domain
4. Follow the [Ubiquitous Language Guidelines](ubiquitous_language_guidelines.md) in your work

## Maintaining This Documentation

This documentation should be treated as a living artifact that evolves with the domain. Follow these guidelines to keep it current:

1. **Regular Reviews**: Schedule quarterly reviews of all ubiquitous language documentation
2. **Update on Change**: Update relevant documents whenever the domain model changes
3. **Collaborative Refinement**: Involve both business and technical stakeholders in terminology decisions
4. **Version Control**: Maintain a history of terminology changes with rationale
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure all team members have easy access to the latest documentation

## Conclusion

The ubiquitous language is the foundation of our Domain-Driven Design approach. By maintaining a comprehensive and consistent set of terminology across all project artifacts, we ensure clear communication between business and technical stakeholders, reduce misunderstandings, and create a domain model that accurately reflects the business domain.
