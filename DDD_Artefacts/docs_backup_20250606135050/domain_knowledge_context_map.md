- **Ownership**: Catalog context is the primary owner
- **Change Process**: Changes require approval from all sharing contexts

### Customer Kernel
- **Shared Between**: Customer, Order, Subscription
- **Key Concepts**: CustomerID, Name, ContactInfo, Preferences
- **Ownership**: Customer context is the primary owner
- **Change Process**: Changes require approval from all sharing contexts

### Order Kernel
- **Shared Between**: Order, Inventory, Payment
- **Key Concepts**: OrderID, OrderItems, Status, PaymentStatus
- **Ownership**: Order context is the primary owner
- **Change Process**: Changes require approval from all sharing contexts

  - Translates discount eligibility rules
  - Handles subscription-specific pricing calculations

### AuthenticationCatalogTranslator
- **Purpose**: Translates between Catalog Authentication and Catalog contexts
- **Transformations**:
  - Maps authentication status to catalog display attributes
  - Translates provenance information to product descriptions
  - Handles authentication-specific product filtering

### OrderPricingTranslator
- **Purpose**: Translates between Order and Pricing contexts
- **Transformations**:
  - Maps order items to pricing requests
  - Translates pricing responses to order line items
  - Handles order-specific discount applications

## Context Map Evolution

The context map should evolve as the system evolves. Key triggers for context map updates include:

1. **New Business Capabilities**: Addition of new bounded contexts
2. **Team Reorganization**: Changes in team ownership of contexts
3. **Integration Pattern Changes**: Shifts in how contexts communicate
4. **Shared Kernel Changes**: Evolution of shared concepts

The context map should be reviewed quarterly to ensure it accurately reflects the current system architecture and team organization.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Context Boundary Enforcement
- Use separate code repositories or modules for each bounded context
- Implement explicit API boundaries between contexts
- Use package visibility modifiers to prevent unauthorized access

### Integration Implementation
- Implement shared kernels as separate libraries with strict versioning
- Use domain events for asynchronous communication between contexts
- Implement anti-corruption layers as dedicated translation services

### Monitoring and Management
- Track cross-context dependencies
- Monitor integration points for performance and errors
- Document context boundaries in code through comments and package structure
