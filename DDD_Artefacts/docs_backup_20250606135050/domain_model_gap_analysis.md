# Domain Model Gap Analysis

This document provides a focused analysis of gaps in the current domain model implementation compared to the business requirements and acceptance criteria.

## 1. Gap Analysis by Bounded Context

### 1.1 Catalog Bounded Context

| Missing Component | Impact | Implementation Priority |
|------------------|--------|------------------------|
| Hierarchical category structure | Cannot organize products properly | High |
| Product search and filtering | Users cannot find products efficiently | Medium |
| Inventory integration | Cannot track stock levels accurately | High |
| Product recommendation engine | Missing cross-sell opportunities | Low |

### 1.2 Customers Bounded Context

| Missing Component | Impact | Implementation Priority |
|------------------|--------|------------------------|
| Customer authentication/authorization | Security vulnerability | High |
| Churn prediction mechanisms | Cannot identify at-risk customers | High |
| Customer preference tracking | Limited personalization | Medium |
| Customer feedback integration | Missing improvement opportunities | Medium |

### 1.3 Ordering Bounded Context

| Missing Component | Impact | Implementation Priority |
|------------------|--------|------------------------|
| Order validation mechanisms | Cannot ensure 99.9% accuracy | Critical |
| Shipping/delivery events | Cannot track deliveries | High |
| Refund processing | Incomplete order lifecycle | High |
| Performance metrics tracking | Cannot measure processing time | Medium |

### 1.4 Pricing Bounded Context

| Missing Component | Impact | Implementation Priority |
|------------------|--------|------------------------|
| Currency conversion mechanisms | Cannot support international pricing | High |
| FX risk hedging | Financial exposure | High |
| ML-based dynamic pricing | Suboptimal pricing decisions | Medium |
| Complete B2B/B2C price tier implementation | Inconsistent pricing | High |

### 1.5 Subscriptions Bounded Context

| Missing Component | Impact | Implementation Priority |
|------------------|--------|------------------------|
| Subscription billing | Cannot collect recurring revenue | Critical |
| Churn tracking mechanisms | Cannot meet 5% churn target | High |
| MRR tracking | Cannot measure growth | High |
| Subscription analytics | Limited business insights | Medium |

### 1.6 Missing Bounded Contexts

| Missing Context | Key Missing Components | Impact | Implementation Priority |
|----------------|------------------------|--------|------------------------|
| Catalog Authentication | Product authenticity verification | Cannot prevent counterfeits | Critical |
| Catalog Authentication | Supply chain transparency | Limited traceability | High |
| Inventory | Dedicated inventory tracking | Stock management issues | Critical |
| Inventory | Forecasting mechanisms | Potential stockouts | High |
| Marketing | Campaign management | Limited customer acquisition | Medium |
| Payment | Dedicated payment processing | Payment reliability issues | Critical |
| Payment | Transaction management | Reconciliation problems | High |

## 2. High-Priority Gaps for Next Sprint

Based on the gap analysis, the following items should be prioritized for the next development sprint:

1. **Critical Priorities:**
   - Implement order validation mechanisms to ensure 99.9% order accuracy
   - Create subscription billing functionality to enable recurring revenue
   - Develop basic product authenticity verification (Catalog Authentication context)
   - Establish dedicated inventory tracking system separate from Catalog context
   - Implement dedicated payment processing service

2. **High Priorities:**
   - Add shipping and delivery tracking events to Order context
   - Implement currency conversion and FX risk hedging in Pricing context
   - Develop churn prediction and tracking mechanisms in Subscription context
   - Complete B2B/B2C price tier implementation
   - Add customer authentication/authorization to Customer context
   - Implement MRR tracking for subscriptions

## 3. Implementation Recommendations

### Short-term (Next Sprint)

1. **Create Missing Domain Events:**
   - `ShipmentScheduled` in Order context
   - `ShipmentDispatched` in Order context
   - `RefundIssued` in Order context
   - `SubscriptionBilled` in Subscription context
   - `CurrencyConverted` in Pricing context

2. **Implement Critical Domain Services:**
   - `OrderValidationService` in Order context
   - `SubscriptionBillingService` in Subscription context
   - `InventoryTrackingService` as new bounded context
   - `PaymentProcessingService` as new bounded context
   - `ProductAuthenticationService` as new bounded context

3. **Enhance Existing Aggregates:**
   - Add validation rules to Order aggregate
   - Add billing properties to Subscription aggregate
   - Add currency support to pricing rules

### Medium-term (Next 2-3 Sprints)

1. **Complete Missing Bounded Contexts:**
   - Fully implement Catalog Authentication context
   - Develop comprehensive Inventory context
   - Create Payment context with transaction management

2. **Implement Analytics Capabilities:**
   - Add MRR and churn tracking to Subscription context
   - Implement performance metrics in Order context
   - Add margin tracking in Pricing context

### Long-term (Future Roadmap)

1. **Advanced Features:**
   - ML-based dynamic pricing
   - Product recommendation engine
   - Advanced churn prediction
   - Marketing campaign management
