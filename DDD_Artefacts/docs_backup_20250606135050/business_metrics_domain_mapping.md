# Business Metrics to Domain Model Mapping

## Purpose

This document maps the business metrics defined in the acceptance criteria to the domain model, ensuring that these critical performance indicators are properly represented in the ubiquitous language and can be measured within the system. It provides guidance on how each metric should be calculated, tracked, and reported.

## Integration with Domain Model

### Value Objects for Metrics

To properly represent business metrics in the domain model, we should create value objects that encapsulate the calculation and validation logic:

```typescript
// Example implementation for a metric value object
export class InventoryAccuracy extends ValueObject<InventoryAccuracyProps> {
  private constructor(props: InventoryAccuracyProps) {
    super(props);
  }

  get value(): number {
    return this.props.value;
  }

  get isWithinTarget(): boolean {
    return this.props.value >= 99.9;
  }

  static create(systemCount: number, actualCount: number): Result<InventoryAccuracy> {
    const accuracy = actualCount > 0 ? (1 - Math.abs(systemCount - actualCount) / actualCount) * 100 : 0;
    
    return Result.ok<InventoryAccuracy>(
      new InventoryAccuracy({ value: accuracy })
    );
  }
}
```

### Domain Services for Metric Calculation

Each bounded context should have dedicated services for calculating and tracking its metrics:

```typescript
// Example implementation for a metric calculation service
export interface SubscriptionMetricsService {
  calculateChurnRate(period: DateRange): Promise<ChurnRate>;
  calculateMRRGrowth(period: DateRange): Promise<MRRGrowth>;
  calculateCustomerLifetimeValue(customerId: CustomerId): Promise<CustomerLifetimeValue>;
  generateMetricsReport(period: DateRange): Promise<SubscriptionMetricsReport>;
}
```

### Domain Events for Metric Thresholds

Create domain events that are triggered when metrics cross important thresholds:

```typescript
// Example implementation for a metric threshold event
export class ChurnRateThresholdExceeded extends DomainEvent {
  constructor(
    public readonly churnRate: ChurnRate,
    public readonly period: DateRange
  ) {
    super({
      aggregateId: new UniqueEntityID('subscription-metrics'),
      dateTimeOccurred: new Date()
    });
  }
}
```

### Repositories for Historical Metrics

Implement repositories to store historical metric data for trend analysis:

```typescript
// Example implementation for a metrics repository
export interface MetricsRepository {
  saveMetric<T extends Metric>(metric: T): Promise<void>;
  getMetricHistory<T extends Metric>(
    metricType: MetricType,
    period: DateRange
  ): Promise<T[]>;
  getLatestMetric<T extends Metric>(metricType: MetricType): Promise<T>;
}
```

## Reporting and Visualization

### Metrics Dashboard

Implement a metrics dashboard that visualizes the current status of all business metrics:

1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Show current values for all metrics with visual indicators for those outside target ranges.
2. **Trend Analysis**: Display historical trends for each metric over time.
3. **Drill-down Capability**: Allow users to explore detailed breakdowns of each metric.
4. **Alert Configuration**: Enable setting of custom alert thresholds beyond the standard targets.

### Integration Points

The metrics system should integrate with other parts of the domain model:

1. **Domain Events**: Subscribe to relevant domain events to update metrics in real-time.
2. **Command Handlers**: Validate operations against metric targets (e.g., prevent actions that would breach margin floors).
3. **Query Services**: Provide read models optimized for metric calculation and reporting.
4. **External Systems**: Export metrics to business intelligence tools for advanced analysis.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Metrics Foundation

1. Define value objects for all business metrics
2. Implement basic calculation services for each bounded context
3. Create repositories for metric storage
4. Establish domain events for threshold violations

### Phase 2: Metrics Integration

1. Connect metrics calculation to existing domain events
2. Implement real-time monitoring capabilities
3. Create basic dashboard for metric visualization
4. Integrate with existing reporting systems

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics

1. Implement predictive analytics for key metrics
2. Create correlation analysis between different metrics
3. Develop automated recommendations based on metric trends
4. Implement machine learning models for metric optimization

## Conclusion

Properly representing business metrics in the domain model is essential for ensuring that the system can effectively track and report on its performance against business goals. By implementing the recommendations in this document, we can create a comprehensive metrics system that is fully integrated with the domain model and provides valuable insights for business stakeholders.
