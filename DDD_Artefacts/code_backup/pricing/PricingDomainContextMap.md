# Pricing Domain Context Map

## Bounded Context: Pricing

The Pricing bounded context is responsible for managing all pricing-related concepts, rules, and calculations across the entire system. It serves as a core domain that other domains depend on for price-related information and calculations.

## Relationships with Other Bounded Contexts

### Catalog Domain
- **Relationship Type**: Partnership (Shared Kernel)
- **Integration Points**:
  - Pricing domain uses product information from Catalog to determine base prices
  - Catalog domain uses Pricing domain to display current prices with appropriate markups and discounts
- **Data Exchange**: Product IDs, base costs, price calculations

### Subscription Domain
- **Relationship Type**: Customer-Supplier
- **Integration Points**:
  - Pricing is the supplier, providing pricing strategies and calculations
  - Subscription domain uses pricing strategies to calculate subscription tier prices
  - Pricing domain applies special rules for subscription-based purchases
- **Data Exchange**: Subscription plan pricing, tier-based discounts, bundled pricing

### Ordering Domain
- **Relationship Type**: Customer-Supplier
- **Integration Points**:
  - Pricing is the supplier, calculating final prices for orders
  - Ordering domain consumes pricing calculations for cart totals, discounts, and promotions
  - Order volume may influence pricing through volume-based strategies
- **Data Exchange**: Final price calculations, promotional pricing, bulk discounts

### Customer Domain
- **Relationship Type**: Conformist
- **Integration Points**:
  - Customer domain provides segment information to pricing domain
  - Pricing strategies are applied based on customer segments
- **Data Exchange**: Customer segments, tiers, special pricing eligibility

## Anti-corruption Layer
The Pricing domain will implement anti-corruption layers where necessary to translate between its own model and the models of other domains, particularly for:
- Translating between catalog's product representation and pricing's product concept
- Converting customer segment data into pricing tiers
- Transforming raw pricing data into domain-specific formats needed by ordering and subscription domains

## Ubiquitous Language Translation
| General Term | Pricing Domain Term | Description |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Price | PriceAmount | The calculated monetary value for a product/service |
| Discount | PriceModifier | Any modification (usually reduction) to a base price |
| Customer Type | PricingTier | The segment-based classification that determines pricing rules |
| Sale | PromotionalCampaign | A time-bound modification to normal pricing rules |

## Strategic Classification
- **Domain Type**: Core Domain
- **Business Value**: High
- **Technical Complexity**: High
- **Implementation Priority**: High
