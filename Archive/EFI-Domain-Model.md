# EFI's eCommerce Platform DDD Document Model 

1. ## Introduction

This document presents a comprehensive Domain-Driven Design (DDD) model for Elias Food Imports (EFI)'s new eCommerce platform. The purpose is to provide a clear and detailed domain model that captures the core business concepts, relationships, and behaviors essential to EFI's operations. This model serves as a foundational blueprint for the software architecture, enabling developers to build a system that aligns closely with EFI's business objectives and enhances customer satisfaction.

The model includes detailed domain models for key subdomains such as Customer Management, Product Catalog, Order Management, Checkout Process, Shipping and Fulfillment, and Payment Processing. It incorporates essential business processes, compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, PCI DSS), and integration considerations with external systems like HubSpot and Stripe, Square and Quickbooks.

5. ### Context Mapping and Relationships

Context Mapping is a strategic Domain-Driven Design (DDD) practice that defines how different Bounded Contexts interact and integrate within the overall system. By clearly establishing boundaries and using integration patterns—such as Anti-Corruption Layers (ACLs), Customer/Supplier relationships, and asynchronous Domain Events—this mapping prevents ambiguity and promotes effective communication between contexts. In addition, the mapping aligns with EFI’s architectural strategy and the relevant policies and business rules governing each interaction.

The following sections detail each bounded context’s primary service, a concise description of its responsibilities, and its interactions with other services. Where applicable, the integration pattern (e.g., ACL, open host service, or event-driven messaging) is noted to clarify the nature of the dependency.

   #### Introduction

In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), **Value Objects** are immutable types defined solely by their attributes and the value they represent, not by a unique identity. They are crucial for:

* **Encapsulating Domain Concepts:** Representing domain-specific values with inherent validation and business rules.  
* **Ensuring Data Integrity:** Validating and enforcing business rules upon creation, ensuring the system's state remains consistent.  
* **Promoting Immutability:** Leading to safer, more predictable code by preventing unintended side effects.  
* **Enhancing Expressiveness:** Providing meaningful types instead of primitive data types, improving code readability and maintainability.

In the EFI eCommerce Platform, Value Objects are used across various bounded contexts to accurately model domain-specific concepts, ensure data validity, and encapsulate domain logic.

  * Two Value Objects are equal if all their attributes are equal. Implement equality checks accordingly.  
* **Encapsulation of Behavior:**  
  * Encapsulate domain-specific logic within Value Objects (e.g., currency conversion in `Money`, formatting in `Address`).  
* **Reusability and Ubiquity:**  
  * Design Value Objects to be reusable across different contexts when they represent the same concept (e.g., `Money`, `EmailAddress`).  
* **Avoid Primitive Obsession:**  
  * Replace primitive data types with Value Objects to provide context and encapsulate validation logic, enhancing code expressiveness.  
* **Serializable and Portable:**  
  * Ensure Value Objects can be serialized for storage or transmission if necessary, respecting security considerations.  
* **Minimal Side Effects:**  
  * Value Objects should have no side effects; methods should not alter the state of other objects.  
* **Thread Safety:**  
  * Immutability inherently provides thread safety, making Value Objects safe to use in concurrent applications.  
* **Documentation and Clarity:**  
  * Clearly document the purpose, usage, and constraints of each Value Object to aid developers and maintainers.

3. ### Domain Services

   #### Introduction

In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), **Domain Services** are stateless operations that encapsulate significant domain logic not belonging to any specific Entity or Value Object. They are used when:

* **Behavior spans multiple Entities or Aggregates**: Operations involve coordination between different parts of the domain model.  
* **Complex calculations or business rules**: Logic that doesn't fit naturally within an Entity or Value Object.  
* **Policies or workflows**: Implementing domain-specific processes that require orchestrating multiple steps.

Domain Services should:

* **Express domain concepts**: Reflect meaningful operations within the domain.  
* **Stay within the domain layer**: Not include infrastructure or application concerns.  
* **Be stateless**: They may rely on state from Entities or Repositories but don't maintain their own state between calls.

In the EFI eCommerce Platform, Domain Services play a crucial role in implementing business policies and coordinating actions across different bounded contexts.

4. ### Repositories

## **Introduction**

In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), **Repositories** are abstractions that encapsulate the logic required to access data sources, providing an interface to store and retrieve **Entities** and **Aggregates**. They serve as mediators between the domain and data mapping layers, offering a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects.

**Key Characteristics of Repositories:**

* **Abstraction of Persistence:**  
  * Hide the details of data storage mechanisms, allowing the domain model to remain persistence-ignorant.  
* **Collection-like Interface:**  
  * Provide methods to add, remove, and retrieve domain objects as if interacting with an in-memory collection.  
* **Work with Aggregates:**  
  * Typically designed for Aggregates, ensuring that the Aggregate Root is the only entry point for data access.

Repositories in the EFI eCommerce Platform are critical for:

* **Maintaining Data Integrity:**  
  * Ensuring that only valid domain objects are persisted, and that invariants are maintained.  
* **Facilitating Testability:**  
  * By abstracting persistence, Repositories make it easier to test domain logic without relying on infrastructure.  
* **Supporting Scalability:**  
  * Efficient data access patterns contribute to the overall performance of the system.

## **General Design Principles for Repositories**

* **Persistence Ignorance:**  
  * The domain model remains unaware of the underlying data storage mechanisms. Repositories abstract away database concerns.  
* **Aggregate Boundaries:**  
  * Repositories should only provide access to **Aggregate Roots**, ensuring that all modifications pass through the Aggregate Root to maintain consistency and enforce invariants.  
* **Unit of Work:**  
  * Implement a Unit of Work pattern if necessary to manage transactions and batch operations across multiple Repositories, ensuring atomicity.  
* **Transaction Management:**  
  * Repositories should handle transactions appropriately, ensuring data integrity and consistency, especially during complex operations.  
* **Abstraction and Interface Definition:**  
  * Define Repositories via interfaces or abstract classes to allow for flexibility in implementation and facilitate testing with mock or in-memory repositories.  
* **Query Methods:**  
  * Provide query methods that support the needs of the application while adhering to the principles of the domain model. Avoid adding unnecessary complexity or exposing internal structures.  
* **Performance Considerations:**  
  * Optimize data access patterns, use caching where appropriate, and consider the impact of database queries on performance. Leverage indexes and query optimization techniques.  
* **Security and Compliance:**  
  * Ensure that Repositories enforce security policies, such as data encryption, access controls, and compliance with regulations like PCI DSS and GDPR.  
* **Error Handling:**  
  * Implement robust error handling and logging within Repositories to aid in diagnosing issues and maintaining system stability.  
* **Consistency and Concurrency:**  
  * Handle concurrency concerns, such as implementing optimistic concurrency control or locks, to prevent data conflicts and ensure consistency.  
* **Scalability:**  
  * Design Repositories to support scaling strategies, such as sharding or partitioning, if necessary, to handle increased load.  
* **Logging and Auditing:**  
  * Keep detailed logs of Repository operations where required, especially for actions that impact critical data or are subject to regulatory compliance.

## **Conclusion**

The Repositories defined above serve as the backbone for data access within the EFI eCommerce Platform. By adhering to Domain-Driven Design principles and eCommerce best practices, they ensure that the domain model remains clean, testable, and maintainable, while supporting the complex data interactions required by the system.

5. ### Domain Events

## **Introduction**

In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), **Domain Events** are notifications that something significant has occurred within the domain. They are immutable, represent past occurrences, and are named in the past tense (e.g., `OrderPlaced`, `PaymentAuthorized`). Domain Events are essential for:

* **Decoupling Services:**  
  * Allowing bounded contexts to react to changes without tight coupling.  
* **Maintaining Consistency:**  
  * Ensuring that all parts of the system are aware of significant changes.  
* **Triggering Side Effects:**  
  * Initiating processes in other services, such as sending notifications or updating data.  
* **Audit and Logging:**  
  * Keeping a record of important events for compliance and analysis.

In the EFI eCommerce Platform, Domain Events facilitate asynchronous communication between services, enforce business policies, and support scalability by enabling event-driven architectures.

## **Design Considerations**

### **Event Naming and Structure**

* **Consistency:**  
  * Use clear, descriptive names in the past tense.  
  * Define a consistent structure for all events.  
* **Payload Design:**  
  * Include only necessary data in the payload to prevent sensitive information exposure.  
  * Use **Value Objects** where appropriate to encapsulate data.

### **Asynchronous Communication**

* **Messaging Systems:**  
  * Implement messaging systems (e.g., message queues, event buses) for event propagation.  
  * Support various communication patterns (publish/subscribe, event streaming).  
* **Scalability:**  
  * Allow services to consume events at their own pace, improving scalability.

### **Eventual Consistency**

* **Acceptance:**  
  * Accept that consumers may not receive events immediately.  
  * Design systems to handle eventual consistency where immediate consistency is not critical.

### **Idempotency**

* **Safe Processing:**  
  * Ensure event handlers can safely process the same event multiple times.  
  * Use unique identifiers and checks to prevent duplicate processing.

### **Security and Privacy**

* **Data Protection:**  
  * Exclude sensitive data from event payloads.  
  * Comply with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) when including customer information.

### **Error Handling and Monitoring**

* **Robustness:**  
  * Implement robust error handling for event publishing and consumption.  
  * Provide retry mechanisms and dead-letter queues for failed events.  
* **Monitoring:**  
  * Monitor event flows to detect and resolve issues promptly.  
  * Use logging and alerting systems.

### **Event Versioning**

* **Evolution:**  
  * Plan for changes in event structure over time.  
  * Include version numbers or use backward-compatible changes.

### **Contracts and Schemas**

* **Definition:**  
  * Define clear contracts or schemas for events.  
  * Use schema registry services if necessary to manage event definitions.

### **Testing and Simulation**

* **Validation:**  
  * Test event flows thoroughly, including edge cases and failure scenarios.  
  * Simulate event storms to ensure the system can handle high loads.

---

## **General Principles**

* **Publish Events from Within Aggregates:**  
  * Raise Domain Events from within Aggregates to reflect true domain occurrences.  
* **Single Responsibility:**  
  * Each event should represent a single, significant occurrence.  
* **Avoid Overloading Events:**  
  * Do not include unrelated data or purposes in a single event.  
* **Eventual Consistency vs. Immediate Consistency:**  
  * Determine where eventual consistency is acceptable and design accordingly.  
* **Minimize Coupling:**  
  * Keep services loosely coupled through well-defined events.  
* **Auditability:**  
  * Use Domain Events as a means to audit actions within the system.  
* **Idempotent Event Handlers:**  
  * Design event handlers to be idempotent to handle duplicate events gracefully.  
* **Security Considerations:**  
  * Ensure that event data does not expose sensitive information.  
* **Documentation:**  
  * Document events clearly, including their purpose, payload, and consumers.  
* **Traceability:**  
  * Correlate events with originating actions for debugging and analysis.

---

## **Conclusion**

The defined Domain Events enable effective communication between different parts of the EFI eCommerce Platform, adhering to Domain-Driven Design principles and eCommerce best practices. They facilitate decoupling, scalability, and maintainability of the system by allowing services to react to significant domain occurrences asynchronously.

6. ### Factories for Aggregate Creation

## **Introduction**

In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), **Factories** are used when creating complex objects or **Aggregates** that require intricate initialization logic, ensuring that the created objects are always in a valid state. Factories encapsulate the creation process, which may involve:

* **Complex Construction Logic:**  
  * When an Aggregate requires multiple steps or dependencies to be instantiated properly.  
* **Encapsulation of Invariants:**  
  * Enforcing business rules and constraints during object creation to maintain the integrity of the domain model.  
* **Simplifying Client Code:**  
  * Hiding the complexity of object creation from consumers of the domain model, promoting usability and reducing errors.

Factories can be implemented as:

* **Factory Methods:**  
  * Static or instance methods on the Aggregate Root or a dedicated Factory class.  
* **Factory Classes:**  
  * Separate classes responsible for creating Aggregates, often used when the creation logic is substantial or involves external dependencies.

In the EFI eCommerce Platform, Factories are utilized to create Aggregates in a consistent and controlled manner, ensuring that all business rules are enforced from the moment an object is instantiated.
